<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2><ul><li><b>Open data</b>:&nbsp; is publicly available data that can be universally and readily accessed, used, and redistributed free of charge.</li>
<li><b>Change</b>: the way <b>governments</b>, <b>nonprofits</b>, and the <b>private sector</b> use data to <u>understand public issues</u> and <u>solve problems</u> in areas as diverse as financial regulation, energy, education, and more.</li>
<li>Review case studies and published research to highlight the following value for using more open data in healthcare:&nbsp;<ul><li>Accountability : healthcare organizations</li>
<li>Choice: patients make informed choices</li>
<li>Efficiency : improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness of healthcare delivery</li>
<li>Outcomes : improving treatment outcome</li>
<li>Patient satisfaction and customer service : educate patients and family to make healthcare institutions more responsive</li>
<li>Economic growth and innovation</li></ul>
</li>
<li><b>Central Goal of this paper</b> :&nbsp;<ul><li>To establish a conceptual framework, or logic model, that can be used by researchers and programme managers to design their open data initiatives and then measure their impact</li>
<li>Assess risks , challenges and potential economic and social benefits</li>
<li>Establish <a href='/THE-OPEN-DATA-ERA-IN-HEALTH-AND-SOCIAL-CARE-1xhWJmS1wJx#:h=IV.-Building-an-open-data-lear'/>ODLE</a></li></ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2><ul><li>舉例:</li>
<li>Mastodon C (Open Data Institute in Shoreditch) :&nbsp;<ul><li>Do: Analysis massive amounts of data on <u>prescription patterns</u> released by the NHS.</li>
<li>Results: significant geographic variations across England</li>
<li>Difference: expensive prescription drugs being prescribed in some areas when generics would work just as well</li>
<li>Impact: if change prescription pattern&nbsp; =&gt; Saves $ 1 billion GPB/year</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Society for Cardiothoracic Surgeons:<ul><li>Do: publishing the results of surgeries done by individual physicians across the UK</li>
<li>Found: Surgical outcomes improved rapidly</li>
<li>Impact : recording/reporting/publishing outcomes =&gt; improve quality of care</li></ul>
</li>
<li>NHS:&nbsp;<ul><li>Do: friends and family” study : ask patient/family to recommend hospital or care center.&nbsp; Then <u>publish the ratings</u></li>
<li>Difference : no rating data =&gt; rating data available</li>
<li>Impact: Give consumers more information and choice , improving care provider quality</li>
<li><br/></li></ul>
</li>
<li>UK experience&nbsp; :&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>Healthcare is one of the sectors with the potential to be most radically transformed by greater data accessibility.</li>
<li>the NHS has invested substantial resources (financial and intellectual) into developing a comprehensive open data strategy</li>
<li>Information concerning <u>GP prescribing</u>, <u>mortality rates</u>, <u>waiting times</u>, and a wide variety of other data has been released to the public and researchers</li>
<li>An incipient ecology of <b>innovation</b>, <b>analysis</b> and <b>research</b> has begun to emerge as a result of such initiatives</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Philosophical (or ethical) argument for open data<ul><li>1. information whose collection is paid for by taxpayers should be available to those taxpayers</li>
<li>2. personal information about individuals (e.g., medical data) should likewise be accessible to those individuals</li>
<li>impact:&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;it facilitates third parties to use it in ways that create new analyses, visualizations, and mash ups</li>
<li>Solving complex challenges requires many people with diverse skills and talents to work together</li>
<li>When experts of all kinds have access to open data, it becomes a catalyst for creative problem solving and community innovation</li>
<li>By making data open, you enable others to bring fresh perspectives, insights, and additional resources to your data, and that’s when it can become really valuable.</li>
<li>the ambitious plan to <b>shift an entire nation’s bureaucracy to more</b> <b>evidence-based decision-making</b></li></ul>

<h2>III. Toward a conceptual framework for open data in healthcare</h2><ul><li>What is a conceptual framework and why do we need one?</li>
<li>Inputs : what open data set was used ?</li>
<li>Users : Who is using the data ?</li>
<li>Activities: How is data used ?</li>
<li>Outputs: What was the value produced by the open data initiative(activity)?</li>
<li>Indicators : To what end ?</li>
<li>Methodologies to Measure impact : According to to what measure?</li>
<li>Impact : To add what value to the NHS and the UK as a whole ?</li></ul>

<h2>IV. Building an open data learning environment (ODLE)</h2><p>As much as the NHS might intend or desire to open all its data, there do of course exist practical constraints. An ODLE can help prioritize <u>which data to make open</u>, and <u>in what</u></p><p><u>way</u>.</p><p></p><ul class="comment"><li>我不太知道怎麼取捨QAQ pathway的部分我先全貼，再想想怎刪修比較好</li></ul>

<p><b>&nbsp;1) BUILD AN OPEN DATA LEARNING CAPACITY AND CULTURE WITHIN THE NHS.</b></p><p></p><undefined><li>Possible Pathways</li></undefined>
<ul><li>Develop an NHS Open Data “<b><u>Do and Learn Tank.</u></b>” Unlike a traditional think tank, this would be structured to help launch new projects using lessons from existing programmes and initiatives and evaluate their results.</li>
<li>Set up an NHS Data Geek Squad to create a corps of <b><u>volunteer data geeks</u></b> and researchers from Britain’s best universities to work with open health data. This could be modeled on Datakind in the U.S., or on Code for America (although Code for America focuses its work city by city rather than by datasets).</li>
<li><b><u>Connect research organizations</u></b> already existing within the NHS, such as the NIHR.ac.uk, that are already examining the impact of open data.149</li>
<li>Use prizes to stimulate new solutions to public problems using open health data, as the UK and U.S. governments have already begun doing.</li>
<li>Develop campaigns designed to promote data sharing, and <b><u>raise awareness about the release of open datasets</u></b>, their locations online, and their potential uses by the public.</li>
<li>Set up an open health data academy that trains people to use open health data and measure its impact, using online learning, project-focused instruction, and mentoring.</li>
<li>Fund the creation of NHS open health data fellowships for students and graduates with compelling ideas and practical ways to implement them.</li>
<li>Develop an open health data <b><u>mentor network</u></b> to encourage and train new recruits and younger members of the NHS in the use of open data.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><b>&nbsp;2) ENGAGE THE PUBLIC IN DEFINING METRICS</b></p><p></p><undefined><li>Possible Pathways</li></undefined>
<ul><li>Develop a <b><u>citizens’ open health data panel</u></b> (similar to Hackney’s online citizen panel) to review metrics on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Facilitate <b><u>user-led design exercises</u></b> to better understand how open data can support stakeholders’ work and ultimately improve people’s lives.</li>
<li>Design and implement online mechanisms such as <b><u>ratings and feedback tools</u></b> to gauge public opinion and solicit insights from citizens.</li>
<li>Create a “<b><u>Metrics Bank</u></b>” of important indicators, with input from stakeholders, researchers, and experts in the field who have studied the relevant literature.</li>
<li>Prioritize the creation of an inventory of datasets by departments within the NHS, and invite experts to curate the datasets released to the public.</li></ul>

<p><b>&nbsp;3) STAY FOCUSED ON WHAT REALLY MATTERS.</b></p><p></p><undefined><li>Possible Pathways</li></undefined>

<p><b>&nbsp;4) DEVELOP A COMMON ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK</b></p><p></p><undefined><li>Possible Pathways</li></undefined>

<p><b>&nbsp;5) STAY FLEXIBLE AND ADAPTIVE IN MEASURING IMPACT.</b></p><p></p><undefined><li>Possible Pathways</li></undefined>

<p><b>&nbsp;6) SHARE WHAT IS LEARNED (INCLUDING FAILURES) WITH EVERYONE</b></p><p></p><undefined><li>Possible Pathways</li></undefined>

<p><b>&nbsp;7) BUILD A RESEARCH NETWORK AND EXPERT NETWORK</b></p><p></p><undefined><li>Possible Pathways</li></undefined>

<p><b>&nbsp;8) DEVELOP OPEN HEALTH DATA ECOLOGY MAP</b></p><p></p><undefined><li>Pathway</li></undefined>

<p><b>&nbsp;9) PUBLISH, INTEGRATE AND FINE-TUNE THE OPEN DATA CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</b></p><p></p><undefined><li>Possible Pathways</li></undefined>

<p><b>&nbsp;10) ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS IN SHAPING THE OPEN HEALTH DATA PROGRAMME</b></p><p></p><undefined><li>Possible Pathways</li></undefined>
