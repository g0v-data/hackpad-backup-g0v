The legislative process, i.e. the amendment of the Taiwanese Civil Code, which had previously obtained cross-party support and the support of the majority of the citizens according to a poll done in 2013, is now under strong pressure from not only pro-LGBT activists, but also conservative religious groups. On December third, some 100,000 people rallied on Ketagalan Blvd. in Taipei, Taiwan, protesting against the legislation, and demanding the preservation of &quot;traditional values&quot;. In response, pro-LGBT groups in Taiwan is organizing an assembly to support the legislation on December 10th, the Human Rights Day, on Ketagalan Blvd., in the belief that the pursuit of equal rights to marry for homosexual align with the core values of the Human Rights Day.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The assembly on Human Rights Day in Taiwan will be echoed world-wide in the same weekend in 28 different cities in the US, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, UK, Switzerland, Norway, Japan, Australia, and Thailand.
