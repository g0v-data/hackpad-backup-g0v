<body><h1>Corporate Influence</h1><p></p><p>Ways in which companies can influence government, and tools to combat that influence:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Commenting on draft regulations<ul><li>Docket Wrench (<a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/tools/docket-wrench/)"></a><a href='http://sunlightfoundation.com/tools/docket-wrench/'/>http://sunlightfoundation.com/tools/docket-wrench/</a>) by the Sunlight Foundation helps groups investigate the regulatory process. In particular, it finds similarly-worded public comments to enable investigators to identify the lobbies among the companies submitting comments. Watch the video for more information.</li></ul>

<li>Disclosure of lobbyist meetings<ul><li><a href="http://quienmanda.es/"></a><a href='http://quienmanda.es/'/>http://quienmanda.es/</a> by Civio tags politicians and businesspeople in public photographs to annotate which companies are lobbying politicians. Spain has little to no regulation of lobbying. The website serves as both a transparency and a campaign tool to introduce lobbying regulation.</li></ul>

<li>Ideological hegemony across politics, industry and the media<ul><li>e.g. via the influence of chaebol</li></ul>
</ul>

<p>Different strategies for combating influence:</p><ul><li>Lobby for new laws</li>
<li>Help enforce existing laws, e.g. via citizen monitoring</li>
<li>Create good PR for good politicians and/or bad PR for bad politicians&nbsp;</li>
<li>Support the media, e.g. by making it easier to investigate by providing them with government information in more accessible, searchable, or usable formats</li></ul>

<p>In the session, we described some of the challenges in Korea:</p><ul><li>Chilling effects (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect)"></a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect). The mainstream media may lose advertising revenue for covering corruption. (There is more coverage by the independent media.) Academics may lose research funding for investigating corporate influence.</li>
<li>The judicial system has a bias towards the status quo and established interests, and is not as strong on defending social justice.</li></ul>

<p>Other notes from the session:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.peoplepower21.org/"></a>http://www.peoplepower21.org/ People&rsquo;s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy (PSPD) monitors the legislature. Its staff/membership is largely made up of professors, researchers, and journalists. It does regular reporting, but no crowdsourcing.</li></ul>
