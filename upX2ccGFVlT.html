I have worked as a teacher, as a musician and as a maker entrepreneur. Since I was a student I have been involved in Madrid in different activist movements: Self-organised protest against Irak War, cultural autonomism squatting, Critical-mass bike movement, assembly movements, alternative political parties… After 15-M movement I founded Labodemo.net an organization focused on Internet democracy. We have been researching for some years how Internet could help society to make policies in a collaborative way with direct and deliberative processes. We have created in Podemos a entire strategy involving different tools with hundreds of thousands of people participating. Actually I’m creating a new Lab connected with Madrid Council called DemIC Lab. Our goal is to improve collective intelligence in democratic Internet processes.</p><p></p><p>中文翻譯：</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Pol.is 在台灣: 跨越鴻溝之公共談論、意見徵求與政策</h2><p>Biography</p><p>Colin is founder of Seattle based startup <a href="http://pol.is"></a>http://pol.is, a web app that leverages the real time web, interactive data visualization and machine learning to gather sentiment in an organic, emergent way.

Ping, the first service of this kind to launch in East Asia, adds on to successes elsewhere in two ways: first, Ping provides local candidate information, beyond national party positions. Second, Ping crowd-sources its questions, so that users can ask district-specific questions to each candidate.</p><p>The session will begin by reviewing the then-recent Korean General Election (held April 16) and place Ping in the broader context of the Korean Civic Hacking / Open Data community.</p><p></p><p>Biography</p><p>I&rsquo;m a data journalist/civic hacker at WAGL, a civic tech incubator in Korea. I have a passion for data-driven checks on political power. My recent projects include a parliamentary monitoring/civic involvement site and a Voter Advice Application (VAA) for the Korean general elections.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Consul - 西班牙的開放政府平台與數位民主革命</h2><p>Biography</p><p>Miguel Arana is the Director of the Madrid city council participation project.
