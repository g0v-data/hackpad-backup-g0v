<body><h1>How to Start a Citizen Revolution / <b>What is new politics?</b></h1><p></p><p></p><p>#c<a href='/ep/search/?q=%23c2015&amp;via=0.f106u8zu90x4pt4i2tpqa1yvi'/>b</a>c2015</p><p></p><p><b>Host: </b>Miguel<b> </b>Arana Catania (Madrid city government, 15-m movement), Joseph Kim</p><p></p><p>No one knows.</p><p></p><p>New citizen movement always not led by traditional activists - Spain, Brazil.... In countries with strong activist movement it turned out to be harder to start large movement</p><p></p><p>key points:</p><ul><li>attracting common people<ul><li>traditional activists usually fail to do that</li></ul>
</li>
<li>organize for common people<ul><li>no leader, horizontal, everyone can join</li>
<li>hard to organize over 100 people<ul><li>so we need technology<ul><li>current technology is not ready. we are building the technology to define the future</li>
<li>lots experiments: polis, loomio etc, all work in some sense but not perfect</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>inclusiveness<ul><li>aim to include everybody</li>
<li>strength of movement is directly related to the number of poeple joining</li>
<li>past demostration (in spain) is a little violent, fight with police.&nbsp; this was the general way to do demostration</li>
<li>violence excludes people, and is usually for young male</li>
<li>to include people with child, immgrants. then you are strong</li>
<li>issue:<ul><li>stop (home) eviction<ul><li>people stood in front of the house for people to be evicted, in no violence</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>common language<ul><li>initial feel childish, but reaches common people</li></ul>
</ul>

<p>most of these movement started from something small and stupid: (X movement) from a park to massive.&nbsp; Iseral: from housing for young people to people camping in the square. brazil: started from public transportation ticket price.</p><p>(clkao: related to and affecting common life)</p><p></p><p></p><p>New face:</p><ul><li>from citizen movement, nothing to do with parliament etc</li>
<li>motto<ul><li>we want to new democracy</li>
<li>they (politician) are not representing us</li></ul>
</li>
<li>initial: not wanting to build new politcal party because it falls into old politics<ul><li>for 4 years, just building citizen movement</li>
<li>no change happened</li>
<li>built something for the people<ul><li>(clkao: social capital)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>this is the phases before success</li></ul>
</li>
<li>built new political party from citizen movement</li>
<li>this is working because of previous phases, we can&rsquo;t jump into new party before all the strength built</li></ul>

<ul><li>media<ul><li>from the beginning, use the SNS to explain everything</li>
<li>even when media bias happened, the SNS always reach everyone and people understand the truth</li>
<li>in reality, we are more powerful than the media</li></ul>
</ul>

<p></p><p>new political parties:</p><ul><li>of more tradition<ul><li>with agenda and top-down</li></ul>
</li>
<li>of more citizen movement<ul><li>experts, activists</li>
<li>driven by the citizen</li>
<li>open voting system to propose candidates</li>
<li>tools for everyone to propose and vote</li>
<li>there&rsquo;s still some veritical structure: representer, spokesperson<ul><li>the point is everyone can join and without feeling excluded</li></ul>
</li>
<li>even we are now in government, we are working with outside (regular citizen) rather than inside (party): with a system for citizen to propose issues<ul><li>topics, agenda are not imposed by politicians but defined by the people</li></ul>
</li>
<li>developing open source software, with outside contributor even outside Spain<ul><li>most experts are not inside your institution</li></ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p></p><p>These are the energy and power for the change.</p><p></p><p><b>Q&amp;A</b></p><p></p><ul><li>How did the moevement spread out all over the country?</li></ul>

<p>it&rsquo;s after Arab Spring, and it helped us to understadn the moement should spread outside the country.&nbsp; from the beginning we have international media (web pages in english), connecting different movement, started in may, in oct organized internatiaol demostration, with a manifesto to call for the movement. manifesto has be general so not specific to spain.</p><p></p><p>using ushahidi for people to start local movement and aggregate. 1090 cities demonstrating in Oct.&nbsp; it wasn&rsquo;t actually difficult.</p><p></p><p>people travel around and exchange things learned, for example hand gestures in assembly.</p><p></p><ul><li>When the movement move into politcal party phase, people are avoiding to join. it seems it&rsquo;s not the case in Spain, why?</li></ul>

<p>movement can stop if political party failed in election.&nbsp; it&rsquo;s a balance you have keep the movement whiliest starting politcal party phase.</p><p></p><p>local parties (more movement) and national (more traditional). podemos is becoming more traditional , and is 4th on the upcoming general election.</p><p></p><p>This is game tradtitional party know how to play.&nbsp; they will beat you.</p><p></p><ul><li>The relation between national and local parties?</li></ul>

<p>at the beginning the new party is only podemos. everyone joined in. some revolution and people think it&rsquo;s too tradtion and people start building new local parties. there are some distance between the two.&nbsp; ?? was the leader for podemos.&nbsp; lots of people joining and doing assembly. got traditional leader and assemly lose the power to decide anything inside the party and people left.</p><p></p><p>in the local party there are saslo people from podemos. but more horizontal. local election won, and the local parties are more well know. in general we are supporitng podemos because it&rsquo;s the only similar party going into general election. but we don&rsquo;t really believe the way they are doing things.</p><p></p><ul><li>what are the issues coverd by the local parties?</li></ul>

<p>housing, public education.&nbsp; podemos are based on these issues.&nbsp; each prgoram (platform?0 is decided by each party. but it&rsquo;s all very similar.&nbsp; of course something in the cities you can&rsquo; do from that level, but you let people know it&rsquo;s the driection and what you want to support.&nbsp; if a city of 4m people are supporting a national-level issue, you have a psychological impact.</p><p></p><p>Joseph: in korea, you can&rsquo;t establish lcoal party, you have 5000 from the whole country.</p><p></p><p>when we were building party, we think that&rsquo;s impossible you need millison of people supporting you, in the electrol system.&nbsp; but we did it, once you have somew way to connect people.</p><p></p><p>Joseph: the important thing is to decide what people are doing after having the party? what&rsquo;s the vision?&nbsp; we started a party from with 100 people from subway. it ended after the election.</p><p></p><p>in 15-m, the media asked &quot;what do you want&quot;. &quot;we don&rsquo;t know, we are going to sit and discuss and we&rsquo;ll tell you&quot;. the most important thing is not to have concrete goal in the beginning. the slogan: &quot;we are going slow, because we are going far&quot;</p><p></p><ul><li>can you talk about the general labour condition? average hours communted etc?</li></ul>

<p>it&rsquo;s generally bad. low minimum wage.</p><p></p><ul><li>not sure if this is working in this country.</li></ul>

<p>THis is the same the people from Iseral told me.</p><p></p><ul><li>2008 american beef import protest of 3m people for 4 months.&nbsp; it still failed.&nbsp; we haven&rsquo;t gone far.</li></ul>

<p>3m people is success. we want more change, but this is the first step to get to the final step. you can&rsquo;t expect things happen over night.&nbsp; for real change you have to go through the process.</p><p></p><ul><li>I agree about common people leading the movement.&nbsp; i wonder what you meant by the &quot;small success&quot; before the final success.</li></ul>

<p>in madrid, the hospital were to be privitized, but doctors organized a protest to stop it (for the moment).&nbsp; it was stopped only in madrid. they thought it failed, but it&rsquo;s a small success.</p><p></p><p>for hosuing&nbsp; eviction. there were some people successfully being preveted frmo evietion.&nbsp; first step is some evictions are stopped.&nbsp; it&rsquo;s hard to image all laws are changed in one day. we have to try and fail, and each time go one step further.&nbsp; escalate as it goes.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>what&rsquo;s the balance between horizontal and vertical structurre of leadership.</li></ul>

<ul><li>the relationship between local parties and existing local NGOs</li>
<li>opinion: we&rsquo;ve been through 10 years with internet activism, lots of momenten, we should study how to go through with the change</li></ul>

<ul><li>you emphasize the importance of common people, but i think you are an activist!&nbsp; I think we still need a democratic leader in movement</li></ul>

<p></p><p>I am an activist but i am not significant in the movement. if i lead and tell people what to do, we&rsquo;ll lose.&nbsp; what we do is to step back and let people talk.&nbsp; there were some activist trying to take control, but people don&rsquo;t like that.&nbsp; when people became leaders, they left to make room. because the leaders never worked.&nbsp; it has to go slower.</p><p></p><p>there was a girl who was the leader / spokesperson of the movement.&nbsp; speaks on TV to explain the movement. but she never said something just by herself.&nbsp; she was always just repeating the things decided by the assembly.&nbsp; she never expressed her own opinions.&nbsp; very hard to do this.&nbsp; most people turned out to be leader, and then the opposition and media will attack you and you&rsquo;ll fail, because you are not so good and they will always find something and destroy you. this is what happens to podemos too.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></body>
