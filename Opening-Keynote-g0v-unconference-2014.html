This morning&rsquo;s keynote will have synchronous interpretation where you can access from your laptops. So this is our hackfoldr: bit.ly/g0vsummit2014 . This is the same one as yesterday&rsquo;s. By the side folder we&rsquo;ve merged in today&rsquo;s agenda as well.</p><p></p><p>If you use a computer with VLC player, please use the earphone.</p><p>The icecast interpretation channel is: <a href="http://i.summit.g0v.tw:8554/unconf"></a>http://i.summit.g0v.tw<a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw/unconf'/>:</a><a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw:/unconf'/>8</a><a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw:8/unconf'/>5</a><a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw:85/unconf'/>5</a><a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw:855/unconf'/>4</a><a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw'/>/</a><a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw/'/>u</a><a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw/u'/>n</a><a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw/un'/>c</a><a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw/unc'/>o</a><a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw/unco'/>n</a><a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw/uncon'/>f</a></p><p></p><p>[live feedback] [[audience giggles]]</p><p></p><p>Please take your seats, we&rsquo;re starting soon.</p><p></p><p>In addition to interpretation we also have live Hackpad transcripts — appearing on the screen as it happens in real time!</p><p></p><p>Before we start, we&rsquo;d like to introduce you to IRC, the preferred tool for g0v to hang out in real time. There&rsquo;s approximately 200 people at any time on IRC, so if you have an idea or something to call for participants, you can find collaborators on IRC really quickly.</p><p></p><p>Today we have 5 channels, and you can see what&rsquo;s happening in each room on IRC and relocate accordingly.</p><p></p><p>jimmy&gt; Hi, CL asked me to introduce first-timers and IRC-newbies to IRC. It&rsquo;s a really simple interface for chatting. If you type hack.g0v.tw in your browser, you&rsquo;ll see a dialog box on the bottom right corner, and use it like Google talk to start discussions.</p><p></p><p>Today a lot of our old-timers in hackathon will start pitching our ideas here, and for example I&rsquo;ll look for pm5 [typing pm5:] to send a message that pm5 will see later on.</p><p></p><p>In this mode of discussion, we can ping each other across rooms. Because this is the first-entry tool, if you&rsquo;d like something more user-friendly, you can register on IRCCloud.com with your email, and after login it will ask you the channel to join. Type freenode g0v.tw channel and you&rsquo;ll see the backlogs as well.</p><p></p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to ping people on IRC but has technical difficulties connecting, please ask people around you, or otherwise just connect to <a href="http://hack.g0v.tw/"></a>http://h<a href='http://h'/>a</a><a href='http://ha'/>c</a><a href='http://hac'/>k</a><a href='http://hack'/>.g</a><a href='http://hack.g'/>0</a><a href='http://hack.g0'/>v</a><a href='http://hack.g0v'/>.t</a><a href='http://hack.g0v.t'/>w</a><a href='http://hack.g0v.tw'/>/</a>.</p><p></p><p>[PA: We need extension cords!] [[extension cords arrive]]</p><p></p><p>CL: LOTS of people came to yesterday&rsquo;s venue — A group of people is being diverted back to this location — we&rsquo;ll wait a few minutes for them to arrive.</p><p></p><p>We have English&lt;&gt;Chinese live interpretation, the URL is available in the hackfoldr here. If you&rsquo;d like to connect to the icecast station, please ask people around you for the URL and setting up VLC: <a href="http://i.summit.g0v.tw:8554/unconf"></a><a href='http://i.summit.g0v.tw:8554/unconf'/>http://i.summit.g0v.tw:8554/unconf</a></p><p></p><p>Please use AS_Public as Wifi, it should Just Work (tm).</p><p></p><p>Good Morning everyone! [VERY LOUD MUSIC]</p><p></p><p>I can&rsquo;t adjust the volume... Let me mute the video for now.</p><p></p><p>Let&rsquo;s try again. Welcome to the g0v unconference — most of people were here yesterday [[raises hands]] — This is the first time we have a unconference after a conference. We have bimonthly hackathons, but this time we&rsquo;d like to try a different format.</p><p></p><p>So I&rsquo;ll start explaining what will happen today. Yesterday some people have proposed sessions already. You&rsquo;ll find paper on the whiteboard where you can put in whatever you&rsquo;d like to discuss, work on, or collaborate, grouped slightly by topic.</p><p></p><p>We&rsquo;ll arrange the rooms, clustering together topics that are similar, so you&rsquo;ll be in the same room talking to each other. Tip for unconf: It&rsquo;s not a conference, just faciliate conversation and encourage people to participate and maybe come out with something.</p><p></p><p>We encourage you to find at least one person who takes notes for each session. We have a hackfoldr for the unconf here, and the hackpads are already there — see &quot;Idea Pool&quot; — so you can also put discussions here and related stuff, like a few ones there already.</p><p></p><p>So, we have 5 different rooms. This room will split into two. We have lunch outside, with an close&nbsp; room. 108 is toward the entrance.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Keynote</h2><p>It’s my great honor to introduce Clay Shirky, a professor in ShangHai at the moment, and we WILL have a book signing party.</p><p></p><p>Clay:</p><p></p><p>Thank you all. I talked to a bunch of people last night, I’m sorry to miss yesterday’s conf.</p><p></p><p>I’d like to do an un-keynote in the spirit of this unconference.</p><p></p><p>I want to talk in particular the problem of both political movements have with scale and the problems that people developing software for those movements.</p><p></p><p>1. Modularity</p><p>2. Bridging capital vs Bonding capital</p><p>3. Consensus vs. Decisiveness</p><p></p><p>Let’s start with a basic observation as I sketched on the whiteboard.</p><p></p><p>Politics is getting people to come to an agreement. If two people have to agree, there’s one agreement. 3 people have 3, 4 have 6 pairs, 5 have 10 etc.</p><p></p><p>If you ever wonder why it gets more difficult the more people there is, the reason is MATH.</p><p></p><p>10 gets you 45 lines. The experience we had in high school, it’s correct — the more people a group have, the harder it is for people to join, because a group means everyone knows everyone, so N people requires N+1 connection.</p><p></p><p>Brooks’s mythical man-month, observation of IBM’s projects. IBM always have delayed shipping schedules — not that anyone here has that problem — so IBM will add new people to “speed things up”, but Brooks observes it ALWAYS slows things down.</p><p></p><p>So it’s <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks&rsquo;s_law'/>Brook’s Law</a>: Adding more people to a late project makes it later.</p><p></p><p>The reason is of communication overhead of shared participation.</p><p></p><p>If you’re digging ditches, then it scales linearly. The more coordinated the effort has to be, that harder for growth.</p><p></p><p>The way we put it in NYU is that scale defeats density and vice versa. You can’t have a tight-knit large group. 6 people goes to dinner, but you can’t have intimate conversation with 60 people. It’s not about people liking each other or not.</p><p></p><p>Even worse, that’s true for all imagined densities. You might say fine, “everyone knows half of the people in this room”. Even that density cannot be maintained for scale. For density &gt;0, there is a moderately sized group where it destroys that density.</p><p></p><p>Groups get more complex faster than they get large.</p><p>If you double the group size, you quadruple the overhead of complexity.</p><p></p><p>This isn’t sociology and this isn’t politics, this is MATH.</p><p></p><p>So this is a dilemma.</p><p></p><p>Optimization: First one: Modularity.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Open Source projects tend to go modular with plugin architecture. Not when the code base needs it, but when developers do. Whenever they are tired of maintaining this whole thing, that’s the thing that forces the modularity.</p><p></p><p>Larger code-bases may require modularity, but larger people-bases must become modular.</p><p></p><p>Many political movements started out as a group of people in a room feeling the same way. That natural impulse to preserve the feeling is so good but you can’t maintain it in scale.</p><p></p><p>It’s a long-term problem, widely replicated. How do you get a small group of people who can look each other in the eye, to a large group of people who encompass a large range of interests and skills.</p><p></p><p>There’s a lot of ways to look at the dilemma but no way to get out of it.</p><p></p><p>Yochai Benkler&rsquo;s book: <a href='http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html'/>Coase&rsquo;s Penguin</a> identifies three principles:</p><p></p><p>1. How small is the smallest unit of participation?</p><p>When we move from small to larger public, how small is the smallest useful unit. The smaller, it’s easier for recruit. Recruiting for scale is something you’d like to do.</p><p></p><p>2. How easy is it for people to raise their hand and say I can work on this problem — opaque or complex organization makes it harder for people to find there way in.</p><p>In Occupy Wall Street I observed in 2011, I’ll go to the Park with a mental Blue Helmet “Not taking sides”. I got there, saw the people with their political signs — nothing surprises me — except the “shit is fucked up” sign.</p><p></p><p>But walking into the Park and see people not holding signs but just talking to each other — I saw the food tent — not the signs — but just making sure people are fed and asking “how can I help?” I’m a casual occupier at that time, and I self-identify as occupier because it lets me find a little job and do it. I prepare coffee, help the food station, it’s the little units.</p><p></p><p>Rather than amping everyone, find little units. How easy it is to integrate it into the whole. This is both about politics and software design. Where people makes small contributions to integrate into the whole.</p><p></p><p>Software has something amazing — better styles for arguing and integration — I hope politics adopt that. If you look at how people are arguing on GitHub, that’s a profound model of arguing that says essentially “show you what you’d like to change and let someone else decide whether to integrate it.”</p><p></p><p>It’s built-in modularity. Focusing on the integration of volunteers is what any movements need to consider.</p><p></p><p>The second issue: Political movements must consider bridging social vs bonding social capital.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the two is this. Think of the list of people who will loan you 100 (US) dollars without asking.</p><p></p><p>If you are increasing bonding capital, you are increasing the <i>amount</i> of money that those people will loan you. If you are increasing bridging capital, you increase the <i>number</i> of people who would say “yes”. It matters is that the small group when you fell in love with, it is pure bonding capital.</p><p></p><p>If you look at the drawing here with 10 people and 45 links. Another way is two 5 groups with a bridge between them.</p><p></p><p>With two liaisons, that creates hierarchy of course, but the counter-risk is that you devolve into this hairball of complexity.</p><p></p><p>During the occupy movements, there’s multiple encampments all over the world. There’s never going to be a general assembly. So how can we increase the ties across the world?</p><p></p><p>Our goal was, every occupation needs two groups of two people, each knows two people in two other occupations. That’s the minimum RAID allocation that would survive severed connection. It’s the least dense possible arrangement. That’s the bridging capital.</p><p></p><p>We don’t need to understand or agree, but we do need to communicate.</p><p></p><p>How to build a movement from bonding to bridging capital is a huge design challenge.</p><p></p><p>If there’s a dozen people in the room, the answer you get is “That’s Diane” “That’s Sue” “That’s Scott”</p><p></p><p>40 people, “head of production, Diane”, “chief of …” etc with titles + roles.</p><p></p><p>Last one: Tensions between consensus and decisiveness.</p><p></p><p>Small groups tend to operate by consensus. Everyone has a Sense of the meeting, where everyone understands what’s going on. It’s what we know over and again, does not scale.</p><p></p><p>It’s a tragedy of the human condition. People commit to them but are defeated by scale.</p><p></p><p>In the 1980&rsquo;s, a group called Act Up! emerged to fight the big pharmaceuticals and media around HIV and AIDS. (<a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1929177/'/>Amazing documentary</a>.) In a matter of 10 days they created this incredible movement. It’s like consensus is great!</p><p></p><p>10 days later another document. “We need an executive committee.”</p><p></p><p>It’s spinning out of control! Ultimately in less than 2 weeks, we’ve grown so fast we’re out of consensus range.</p><p></p><p>It’s a permanent problem for any group — software to get people across that would be fantastic.</p><p></p><p>To avoid mistake: Especially with people working on data and code for politics.</p><p></p><p>45 years ago. Internet only had two programs, UUCP(?) and FTP.</p><p></p><p>It would be great to get more people — scientist, researchers, remote access to data — but for years, nothing happens — there’s no third-party programs.</p><p></p><p>Early 70s, where Email was ported from MIT, the internet took off (75% of backbone traffic within 90 days).</p><p></p><p>The most significant thing is not code, not data, but the user. We have to have it. Whenever anything new arrives, we overestimate code and data but underestimate people.</p><p></p><p>So if you’re working on software that makes decision easier, you need to do the emotional piece, otherwise you’re treating people as machine.</p><p></p><p>My friend <a href='http://blog.loomio.org/2014/04/14/marianne-manilov-grassroots-organising-and-looking-after-yourself/'/>Marianne Manilov</a> pointed out: A purely action-motivated movement can keep around for a year but peters out. Does the movement give a substantial time to take care of each other, is the key to going on.</p><p></p><p>“Taking care of each other” in the US is a radical idea. <a href='http://strikedebt.org/'/>Strike Debt</a> and <a href='http://occupysandy.net/'/>Occupy Sandy</a> are the examples of success that focus on these kinds of models: the intersection between politics and care-taking (the Spanish concept is &rsquo;politica affectiva&rsquo; - a politics of social relationships and love).</p><p></p><p>In the spirit of unconference and looking for ways to make progress, I’d say one of the persistent issues dated from the Iranian uprising, is that short term uprising is incredibly available now, but hashing out long-term commitment and communication is still week.</p><p></p><p>Density vs Scale, dealing with the Modularity and Consensus and Decisiveness, and Bonding and Bridging capital.</p><p></p><p>Do not overlook the need of the members who does anything — from coding to occupying — take time commitment to take care of each other, if the movement is going to last.</p><p></p><p>[[CL does Chinese translation of the transcript above]]</p><p>[[[Transcript is over here]]]</p><p></p><p>Any questions for the speaker?</p><p>[我的中文不好，對不起] says Clay</p><p></p><p>Q from Rich:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Arguments on GitHub. that&rsquo;s disagreement by contribution. Instead of just saying no, say &quot;how about this instead.&quot; I think it&rsquo;s a key component, the alternative part.</li>
<li>With the diagram here. The individual people the dots represent. They can choose how to behave. They have different sort of cultural expectations of negotiation. They are not interchangeable parts. So two groups of five are difference.</li></ol>

<p>The loomio vision is to teach people how to recognize the density, and the personal needs in relationship to the group&rsquo;s needs.</p><p></p><p>There are 16 members in Loomio already, but we&rsquo;re functioning really effectively, because we put in the effort in how you operate, and developing the ways to scale but looking into the needs of each other, instead of being ego-centric.</p><p></p><p>Clay: This is simplified diagram. Culture is key. Modularity is a key thing, where I trust the group to do the things over there. But I think the Q of culture is a huge dilemma for us in the US around the movements, is daunting for any liberal people. It&rsquo;s more difficult in a racially diverse groups. It&rsquo;s like the worst news for us. In a community who&rsquo;s diversified, the consensus rate goes down.</p><p></p><p>So in multi-ethnic groups. we have to create &rsquo;artificially&rsquo; increased social capital in the context of multi-ethnic groups. It&rsquo;s also daunting that the two groups who do best with racial integration is Military and Sport teams, because have have clear objectives and an identifiable opponent. It&rsquo;s difficult, but possible, and picking this up is something we have to do.</p><p></p><p>GitHub is great. I love that they are called &quot;commits&quot; — It says implicitly that if you are not &quot;committing&quot; I&rsquo;m not interested.</p><p></p><p>Q:</p><p>Argument on GitHub is also issues. The difference between Code issues vs Political issues is testability and focus. I agree what you&rsquo;re saying around GitHub.</p><p></p><p>[Clay clarifies: The Iranian event I mentioned is the June uprising.]</p><p></p><p>Multi-ethnic relation in Malaysia. We have a lot of work on that. The government — I appreciate what they do — is really helping in this regard.</p><p></p><p>Q:</p><p>Hi I&rsquo;m Billy. Currently we find in Taiwan, most of people here does IT work and contribute to g0v. We are the minority however, we make awesome tools but most people don&rsquo;t know about that. Older people may not actively seek out information, but passively consume newspapers and TV channels, which are obviously manipulated.</p><p></p><p>Our colleagues and classmates, some of them are not used to this kind of tools either — on their Facebook walls are cats photos and games — but they won&rsquo;t read the things that may change their bias. What are your suggestions to motivate such people?</p><p></p><p>A:&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, people mostly don&rsquo;t change their mind, they mostly change their emotions and the mind follows — Like my mental blue helmet — the food tent changed my emotions and made me one of the occupiers.</p><p></p><p>If you concentrate on media as a way to transmit information, you&rsquo;re playing in the field most controlled by your opponents. You need to communicate the emotion instead.</p><p></p><p>[[Tammy translate back to Mandarin for Billy]]</p><p></p><p>Second thing. Never underestimate the power of a cute :cat:&nbsp; !</p><p></p><p>The &quot;Cute Cat Theory&quot; of internet dissidents is no joke! This is widely believed to be true — the tools designed just for political dissent will be ignored, but if you can transmit cute :cat2: on the same channel — it&rsquo;s a huge advantage. :dog:&nbsp;&nbsp; :dog2:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Anthropologist Addition: In mainland China, the street art of political web. When 陳光誠 was arrested people put on sunglasses and staged CGC/KFC art images, which are harder to censor than words — don&rsquo;t underestimate the ability of ART! [see this amazing book about creative activism:&nbsp; <a href="http://beautifultrouble.org/"></a>http://beautifultrouble.org/]</p><p><img src='http://www.minzhuzhongguo.org/english/UploadCenter/ArticlePics/2012/17/201251chen_guangcheng_KFC.jpg'/></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Image from <a href="http://www.minzhuzhongguo.org/english/ArtShow.aspx?AID=27468"></a>http://www.minzhuzhongguo.org/english/ArtShow.aspx?AID=27468</li></ul>

<p>Last thing: If you are talking to people who don&rsquo;t agree with you — say, middle-aged people — Don&rsquo;t ask yourself how to get them to believe everything you believe — Ask if you can get them to believe anything you believe.&nbsp; Try to get across one thing, so you are not one crazy marginal figure — get them willing to listen to you because you said one sensible thing. If you can say one thing that makes sense — like Occupy Wall Street&rsquo;s message about income inequality — get the one thing through and work with that.</p><p></p><p>CL: One more Q...</p><p></p><p>Q: Do you think the government can be operated in a modular way instead of a hierarchical system? Should the affairs in government encourage people to participate in the governance in small ways?</p><p></p><p>A: Given the logic of at least democratic governments, any form of citizen participation raises the social capital. Over and again when people study disasters, what makes a place resilient is whether people before the tsunami etc knew each other. It&rsquo;s not what government does or sirens — those thing are important — but the vital thing is whether people know and trust each other. Any kind of participation is valuable for that.</p><p></p><p>I understand the concept of 關係, and that&rsquo;s what matters, says Clay.</p><p></p><p>To the first half: Don&rsquo;t think that modular necessarily means non-hierarchical, or vice versa. Hierarchy is a tool. Stamping it out is only useful when it&rsquo;s part of a larger goal. I think modularity is a good goal, it&rsquo;s evidently possible to scale out and up with modularity — the real Q is where can we leverage this — like in Icelandic constitutional referendum — it&rsquo;s often pulled back by people in power. The Q is not about the tools, the Q is where can we find a country, or at least a city, that is willing to experiment with.</p><p></p><p>CL: I&rsquo;d like to close this opening with a saying of Clay&rsquo;s: The most important thing with a hackathon is not the production, but the social capital that we produce.</p><p></p><p>We&rsquo;ll separate in 5 rooms, so please write-in the topics you&rsquo;d like to work on or discuss. It&rsquo;s not about presentation, but actually starting conversations by participants interested. Hackfoldr has the hackpad for each room and we&rsquo;d like to ask volunteers to keep notes.</p><p></p><p>There&rsquo;s food outside — please have food outside, not in this room — so feel free to come to the whiteboard and pitch in, and note the language of your preference.</p><p></p><p>So, food and planning time!</p><p></p><p>[[PA: The TutorABC booths has surveys for people who had experience with their equipments of interpretation yesterday.]]</p><p></p><p>[[Planning sessions ensue]]]</p><p></p></body>
