Could you give us a brief introduction about yourself and Public Laboratory?</p><p></p><p>Sure, um, well, my name is Liz Barry. I&rsquo;m also extremely excited to be coming to the g0v Summit. I work with a large open source community called the Public Laboratory for open technology and science. And I also work with other types of environmental data production like TreeKit, which is just work with the city of New York to survey all of the urban street trees here. Something that thousands of people participated in, to create high quality data that now, the governments and the citizens can use to collaborate.</p><p></p><p>Most of my work, though, is with the Public Laboratory for open technology and science. And we are tackling as a community, many different types of environmental investigations. I think the really special thing about the PublicLab community is that, it&rsquo;s a place where people who have different sorts of expertise, can interact with each other, in a conversational pleasant environment and we actually learn from each other. We are understanding what policies are in place to manage the environment. We&rsquo;re looking into what is the techno-science that these policies are based on. And we actually have many people in our community doing hardware development on making research equipment so that people can conduct their own environmental investigations.</p><p></p><p>That sounds awesome. So, like how many people are participating in Public Laboratory, like the online community for environmental monitoring discussion?</p><p></p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to count. But there seem to be about 10,000 people involved here now. We don&rsquo;t hear from them all the time, and it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re trying to understand right now. There&rsquo;s a ...Among all these people, there&rsquo;s a community leadership group called the organizers. And there people they decided themselves that they wanted to become more active. And I think the distribution of there eighty people around world is maybe a better representation of our diversity.</p><p></p><p>Well, that sounds like a huge crowd also an awesome thing. What&rsquo;s the most import impact the the PublicLab and the whole community has brought?</p><p></p><p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a few way to answer that question. As with any large group of people where there&rsquo;s a lot of projects, we&rsquo;re having a number of different kind of impacts. The data collected by our tools primarily our aerial mapping tools, using just plain old cameras, to take aerial photos, in visible or infrared and stitch them into maps. It seems like that kind of photographic evidence is able to have the most impact and in the courts and the media, and in just communicating with policymakers. We&rsquo;re working on a number of other tools ranging from particulate matter sensing(?) to spectroscopy to identify different type of oil. And it&rsquo;s not just the hardware development that&rsquo;s requried to get these tools to work but also understanding where into the government system and environment manangement, regulation and enforcement can that data be heard.</p><p></p><p>So I think broadly going into what it really takes to manage the environment collaboratively between citizens and government, that&rsquo;s a bit impact of us overall. I would also say, and I&rsquo;ll probably guilty a little bit to bring this point up because it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m personally interested in, something I&rsquo;ve been working on since very early days of PublicLab getting together. But, I&rsquo;m very interested in how the social practices that have evolved on the internet to support the kind of massive collaborative projects like we see in open source software and knowledge production like in Wikipedia.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Part2 (5:01-10:00)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part3 (10:01-15:00)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part4 (15:01-22:44)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><h2>Jen</h2><p>影片連結：<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA3FpAwqzVM"></a><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA3FpAwqzVM'/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA3FpAwqzVM</a> ( 總共 15:15 )</p><p></p><p><b>Part1 (0:00-5:00)&nbsp;</b></p><p>認領人：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part2 (5:01-10:00)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part3 (10:01-15:15)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><h2>Yago </h2><p>影片連結：<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX3XNjq93K4"></a><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX3XNjq93K4'/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX3XNjq93K4</a> ( 總共 18:56 )</p><p></p><p><b>Part1 (0:00-5:00)&nbsp;</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part2 (5:01-10:00)</b></p><p>認領人：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part3 (10:01-15:00)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part4 (15:01-18:56)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></body>
