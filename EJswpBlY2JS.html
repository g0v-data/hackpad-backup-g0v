<p>英文腳本：</p><p>Hello!</p><p>ok it&rsquo;s on air!</p><p>right now</p><p>Hello Rajib</p><p>Hi</p><p>Hello</p><p>So, Say hi to Taiwan and tell us about yourself please</p><p>ok hello, Taiwan, I am a social researcher(?), and also a part-time legislator at the junior varsity(?). I work in so many social innovative ideas and other words.</p><p></p><p>That&rsquo;s good. So we&rsquo;re very excited to have you here.</p><p></p><p>Thank you so much, I&rsquo;m also excited to be there, to meet other people, listen to them, and also see some ideas. xxx?</p><p></p><p>What do you do before and how did you get into the civic tech field?</p><p></p><p>Actually, I was involved in some social research projects, and also teaching field(?), so I met a lot of people in Nepal, .... I travel, I met them. Those meeting, like listening to them, I heard so many problems. ...and the problem related to the government service, like providing mechanisms that trigger my idea. I wanted to support to solve their day-to-day problem of accessing the government services. And so that the eager to help people in solving problem, was once cause ...let, attracted me... to civic field.</p><p></p><p>And also I met some of my friends, like ...., they are from technical field. And we discuss a lot how we can help the people to access the services from the government offices. Then we found GaliGali, ... edition.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>At the beginning, it was like working to map the streets. And the &quot;GaliGali&quot; word in Nepali means the &quot;streets&quot;, the &quot;neighborhood&quot;. So the beginning idea was to map the streets, and create some digital maps of Kathmandu. Because online you can&rsquo;t find reliable maps. But we couldn&rsquo;t do. Because of so many problems. Then we stiff change like to our end to support the people in accessing the government&rsquo;s xxxx... So that we can help for democracy. It&rsquo;s like building .... the knowledge ... and the knowledge to open source, that people can get access to information. And that can sustain, and they don&rsquo;t feel to reach the gap of ... citizen and the state. So we are ... that will eventually help to .... democracy. Also promote ..... using the technology.</p><p></p><p>That&rsquo;s great!</p><p>So is the global civic tech community actually bring impact to you, on your opinion?</p><p></p><p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s obvious. Because so far the technology now will be coming to the general people ... Now, no more that the technology is with the technicians, now even the common people, they are getting benefits out of it. Because now they can contribute, by providing information, and open source the crowdsourcing platform, they can participated in it, and also they can use the information to it. So I see like lot of impacts. And even if we observe the last 10 years, in Nepal, like the mobile penetration rate is so high. In 2006, 2007(?)... 2016(?), we have like almost 50% mobile penetration rate. That means all of them have access to internet, GPRS mobile internet, so they can get access to technology, and also they can use the information.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>So I think now, this global civic tech community, because of this .... we can help to solve the daily problem. Even the small problem they can solve ... with civic technology.</p><p></p><p>What sessions in g0v summit sounds more interesting to you? Did you see the agenda we publish?</p><p></p><p>Yeah, I saw a lot of interesting agendas. And I saw there are some people from Myanmar, talking about using civic technology .... election and democracy. I also saw that will tell about ...maybe ... China ..about how they are .... cloud ... supervision ...... So I&rsquo;m interested to hear all these people who are using civic technology in different fields. And also more interesting, I&rsquo;m eager to know like what are the challenges they are facing in their xx, because we are also facing some .. right here, so I also want to know like ... there are sessions which deals about how they are tackling the problems. I think that would be ... for me ...that will leave us some xxx or some ways of how they are dealing with issues and problems, that we can try here. ...from different ...., like China, Taiwan, Myanmar, ...</p><p></p><p>Okay! So that&rsquo;s it. Thank you for the interview. And we are looking forward to have you here.</p><p></p><p>It&rsquo;s my pleasure to talk with you and also thank you for arranging the meeting. ....</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Liz</h2><p>影片連結：<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbX8mQT5E40"></a><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbX8mQT5E40'/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbX8mQT5E40</a>&nbsp; ( 總共 22:44 )</p><p></p><p><b>(V) Part1 (0:00-5:00)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：soidid</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p>Hello Liz!</p><p>Hi clkao!</p><p></p><p>So we&rsquo;re very exciting about you coming to the g0v Summit in May. Could you give us a brief introduction about yourself and Public Laboratory?</p><p></p><p>Sure, um, well, my name is Liz Barry. I&rsquo;m also extremely excited to be coming to the g0v Summit. I work with a large open source community called the Public Laboratory for open technology and science. And I also work with other types of environmental data production like TreeKit, which is just work with the city of New York to survey all of the urban street trees here. Something that thousands of people participated in, to create high quality data that now, the governments and the citizens can use to collaborate.</p><p></p><p>Most of my work, though, is with the Public Laboratory for open technology and science. And we are tackling as a community, many different types of environmental investigations. I think the really special thing about the PublicLab community is that, it&rsquo;s a place where people who have different sorts of expertise, can interact with each other, in a conversational pleasant environment and we actually learn from each other. We are understanding what policies are in place to manage the environment. We&rsquo;re looking into what is the techno-science that these policies are based on. And we actually have many people in our community doing hardware development on making research equipment so that people can conduct their own environmental investigations.</p><p></p><p>That sounds awesome. So, like how many people are participating in Public Laboratory, like the online community for environmental monitoring discussion?</p><p></p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to count. But there seem to be about 10,000 people involved here now. We don&rsquo;t hear from them all the time, and it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re trying to understand right now. There&rsquo;s a ...Among all these people, there&rsquo;s a community leadership group called the organizers. And there people they decided themselves that they wanted to become more active. And I think the distribution of there eighty people around world is maybe a better representation of our diversity.</p><p></p><p>Well, that sounds like a huge crowd also an awesome thing. What&rsquo;s the most import impact the the PublicLab and the whole community has brought?</p><p></p><p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a few way to answer that question. As with any large group of people where there&rsquo;s a lot of projects, we&rsquo;re having a number of different kind of impacts. The data collected by our tools primarily our aerial mapping tools, using just plain old cameras, to take aerial photos, in visible or infrared and stitch them into maps. It seems like that kind of photographic evidence is able to have the most impact and in the courts and the media, and in just communicating with policymakers. We&rsquo;re working on a number of other tools ranging from particulate matter sensing(?) to spectroscopy to identify different type of oil. And it&rsquo;s not just the hardware development that&rsquo;s required to get these tools to work but also understanding where into the government system and environment management, regulation and enforcement can that data be heard.</p><p></p><p>So I think broadly going into what it really takes to manage the environment collaboratively between citizens and government, that&rsquo;s a bit impact of us overall. I would also say, and I&rsquo;ll probably guilty a little bit to bring this point up because it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m personally interested in, something I&rsquo;ve been working on since very early days of PublicLab getting together. But, I&rsquo;m very interested in how the social practices that have evolved on the internet to support the kind of massive collaborative projects like we see in open source software and knowledge production like in Wikipedia.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Part2 (5:01-10:00)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：soidid</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p>How to we take the range and the innovative capacity of this commons-based peer production, and use it with other well-known offline forms of social organization that are also known to generate huge social and political outcomes. So in the western hemisphere, we are talking about community organizing, community development corporations, building networks and stakeholders, grass-root campaigns, popular education movements. And in PublicLab, it&rsquo;s very interesting how our online and offline components work together. We have the online social practices that works xxx you know, that you would really recognize from many other open source movements. And then you see people going out and doing research and and building local campaigns, in a way that you would recognize from traditional grass-root political organizing.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>So I&rsquo;m very interested in that combination. And that&rsquo;s one of the real reasons that I&rsquo;m excited to come to the g0v Summit. I had a opportunity over the past over years, to build more collaboration with people in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. And it has been a non-stop learning experience for me. And I&rsquo;m really excited to connect with different civil sector movements in Asia. Because I think, you know, the Public Laboratory has been primary western hemisphere, and just in January, actually just a couple of weeks ago, we got our first mainland-China-based organizer, who I&rsquo;m really excited ....that she&rsquo;s gonna be coming to the g0v Summit as well.So I just think there&rsquo;s a huge opportunity for cultural exchange, for people working in this space.</p><p></p><p>Can you tell us a bit more about the new collaboration are doing with the teams in China, what have they achieved and how are organizing work there?</p><p></p><p>There are a lot of incredible environmental activists in China, I just fortunate enough to have the opportunity to meet a couple of them. I first met ... I first began to connect with the activists two years ago, in January 2014, during the mad &quot;Making a Difference&quot; conference in Hong Kong. And at that time I met Greenovation Hub, and Hershan(?) who introduced herself by saying, &quot;Oh, hi! I&rsquo;ve heard Public Laboratory, and also we have undertaken a very small citizen science project.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Well, she&rsquo;s very modest come to find out that they had designed, manufactured and distributed over 1,000 pH testing kits. And held a public event along a very long river where people were sampling and uploading water quality data to a website that they also built. And at the same time they were collecting oral histories from the older generation who remember the rivers before the factories came.</p><p></p><p>So this is what they were already doing, and if it&rsquo;s not obvious, let me say it, that is one of - although they disregard(?) it as a small project - that&rsquo;s actually one of the largest citizen science water quality events in the world. And I&rsquo;m so glad ---- (9:03)</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Part3 (10:01-15:00)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part4 (15:01-22:44)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><h2>Jen</h2><p>影片連結：<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA3FpAwqzVM"></a><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA3FpAwqzVM'/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA3FpAwqzVM</a> ( 總共 15:15 )</p><p></p><p><b>Part1 (0:00-5:00)&nbsp;</b></p><p>認領人：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part2 (5:01-10:00)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part3 (10:01-15:15)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><h2>Yago </h2><p>影片連結：<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX3XNjq93K4"></a><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX3XNjq93K4'/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX3XNjq93K4</a> ( 總共 18:56 )</p><p></p><p><b>Part1 (0:00-5:00)&nbsp;</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part2 (5:01-10:00)</b></p><p>認領人：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part3 (10:01-15:00)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p><b>Part4 (15:01-18:56)</b></p><p>認領人 &amp; 簽名同意 CC0 釋出：</p><p>英文腳本：</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></body>
