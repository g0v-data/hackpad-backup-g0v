<body><h1>Interview Q&amp;A For Shareable</h1><p>Hello everyone! I&rsquo;m a freelance journalist working on a story for the US-based non-profit publications Shareable. Everything we publish is licensed CC 3.0.</p><p></p><p>Please add your input to the questions below - and put your name at the top so I know how many people participated. I&rsquo;m looking for 1200-1500 words total for the story so feel free to give detailed answers.</p><p></p><p>Contributors:</p><p>ael</p><p></p><p>Questions</p><p></p><p>#1 - Can you tell us a bit about how G0v operates - your governance structure, how decisions are made, and how you communicate within your network?</p><p>ael: First of all, g0v does not have a &quot;governance&quot; structure. We consider ourselves as a community rather than an organization. Like other open source tech communities, we believe everyone is equal to participate in the community. We welcome every citizen to join any projects since all our projects are all open online, including codes, documents, videos and images etc. So how does it work? Online, we throw up our projects ideas, discuss thoughts and look for collaboration in our Facebook group, our Slack group, our irc channel, our hackpad workspace and our GitHub repository. Offline, we host at least one hackathon every two months, around 120 participants each time, and also host 2 international summits to connect to the global civic tech hackers.&nbsp; We are a multi-centered community, which means anyone can initiate any projects and host hackathons on their own. We believe in openness and collaboration. Every Facebook Fanpage posts will be reviewed by the community before released. Any lecture invitation will be send to a Google group, and the lecture slides will be open.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#2 - What would you consider some of your biggest, or more meaningful achievements?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#3 - Are there any challenges you have encountered since you started up, specifically around collaboration, or large-scale mobilizations?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#3 - What are some of the most exciting, or most promising, projects that you are working on right now?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#4 - Has there been any changes, or developments, since the new President came into power last year? Why is it so important to involve citizens in decision-making?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#5 - Though G0v is probably leading in innovations, it seems like other organizations with similar goals are emerging elsewhere in Asia. Can you tell me if, and how, you&rsquo;re working with activists/hackers in other Asian countries?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#6 -&nbsp; Are there any lessons g0v can offer the platform co-op movement in terms of collaboratively organizing/mobilizing large groups of people?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></body>
