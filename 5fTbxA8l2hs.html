<body><h1>Household Registration Office&rsquo;s system is terribly slow</h1><p></p><p>Monday morning (31/03/2014) in XinDian&rsquo;s Household registration Office, people had to wait 2 hours to get simple papers like a 戶籍謄本. Everybody was waiting, the staff and the people. I wrote a note and placed it in the suggestion box of the office:</p><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp;-&gt; 戶籍謄本 -&gt; Household Certificate Transcript</li></ul>

<ul style="list-style: none;"><li><b>&quot;Your computer system is too slow. Some software engineers are willing to fix it for free. Please contact the organisation G0V.&quot;</b></li></ul>

<p>Yesterday and today, I received this email as an answer:</p><p></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li><b>郭先生您好，</b></li>
<li><b>有關您建議的事項因涉及資安及控管問題，有關系統維修(護)由主管機關內政部統籌辦理，很感謝您對本所提供之意見，本所會持續反映，希望可以盡速改善，為您提供更快更好的服務，有任何問題歡迎來電指教。</b></li>

<li><b>新北市新店戶政事務所</b></li><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp;It means, this issue has security concern, and the authority, Ministry of Interior, is responsible for&nbsp; maintaining the new household system. They can do nothing but report the issue to the MOI. :(</li>
<li>Maybe we can do something and send complains and request to give a chance to citizens to review the source code and and provide patches.</li></ul>
</ul>

<p>Is there anybody who would like to contact with them and see if there is a way to let us contribute ? (my Chinese might not be good enough to talk to them).</p><p></p><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp;The new household system just sucks. A lot of media already reported about this.<ul class="comment"><li><a href="http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20140219/35650550/"></a>http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20140219/35650550/<ul class="comment"><li>-- &quot;The new household system did not pass ANY test before it is online&quot;</li>
<li>And the authorities had promised to fix all issues. The system is outsourced to a company, so it will be a little bit hard (in policy aspect) to contribute for the g0v.</li>
<li>I thought that they promised to fix it a while ago. Maybe now is the right time to propose an external help (us, programmers ?). To propose help is the first stage of a change, even if we know that it will probably be refused.</li></ul>
