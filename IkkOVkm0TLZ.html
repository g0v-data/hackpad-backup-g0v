<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Open Data / Taiwan 貼的</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/OpenData.tw/posts/1015196618539459"></a>https://www.facebook.com/OpenData.tw/posts/1015196618539459</p><p></p><h2>英文 Email 版</h2><p>[Greeting],</p><p></p><p>This year&rsquo;s g0v Summit will take place in May 14-15, 2016 at Taipei&rsquo;s Academia Sinica.</p><p></p><p><a href='http://g0v.tw/en-US/about.html'/>g0v</a> is a civic tech community established in late 2012 with deep open-source roots. With 1,000+ contributors through 30+ hackathons, it is <a href='http://sbaack.com/2015/11/19/scraping-the-global-civic-tech-community-on-github-part-2.html'/>recognized</a> as one of the largest group in the global civic tech community.&nbsp; The results are many civic-made tools for better information disclosure, citizen engagement, and online democracy.&nbsp; g0v community is one of the major driving forces for official adoption of better Open Data practices in Taiwan, whose achievement is recognized by OKFN in their <a href='http://index.okfn.org/place/'/>2015 survey</a>.</p><p></p><p>g0v Summit 2014 had 43 speakers from 9 countries with diverse backgrounds, including Open Data evangelists, public servants, NPO/NGO workers, scholars, and entrepreneurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The g0v community has been running for almost four years. From the outset, we have adopted the thinking of the digital generation and used an open source approach to facilitate mass participation, develop new tools, experimenting with new organizational patterns, and establish new partnerships.</p><p></p><p>After the Sunflower Student Movement in 2014, g0v community has, through its open nature, actively used technologies to promote government transparency and attract participants on different topics. Through hackathons of various sizes, we have experimented with new modes of media and participation, forming a series of processes that replace old practices with new pathways.</p><p></p><undefined><li>Fork and Merge</li></undefined>

<p>Today, when openness, transparency and participation have become popular keywords, g0v continues to move forward while maintaining its open source model, activism and civic spirit. We are also keeping up with the new changes in Taiwan&rsquo;s society and democracy.</p><p></p><p>In 2016, Taiwan will usher in a new government. Mass participation is on the rise, and new media forms will replace old ones. Through a variety of experiments and explorations, we will continue to seek interdisciplinary channels of communication.</p><p></p><p>Sharing our practical experiences and bringing about substantial change is the effect of the dialogue that we are looking forward to having at the g0v Summit 2016.</p><p></p><undefined><li>Calling for Speakers</li></undefined>

<p>For this year&rsquo;s summit, we hope that it will become a communication platform to enable people to take part in social change. We sincerely invite and welcome old and new participants who are&nbsp; interested in the following topics to send us their submissions, so that we can combine our strengths and become a united force for practical&nbsp; change:</p><p></p><ul><li>[List of topics go here]</li></ul>

<p>The time of each topic is 30 minutes. If there are many similarly themed discussion topics, we may also adjust the format to a panel.</p><p></p><p>The submission period is 1/11 - 2/22. We will notify and publish the results on February 29.</p><p></p><p><b>Traveling and accommodation</b></p><p></p><p>We have limited funding for travel and accommodation for overseas&nbsp; speakers.&nbsp; If you have your own funding source, we would be happy to&nbsp; list the funding organization as a sponsor of the event.</p><p></p></body>
