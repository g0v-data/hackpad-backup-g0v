<ul><li><b>Inspiration Phase</b></li></ul>

<h2>Step 1: Choose a Design Challenge</h2><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Collect Thoughts｜Review What You Already Know｜Define What You Don’t Know｜Review Constraints or Barriers</li>
<li><br/></li></ul style="list-style: none;">
<h2>Step 2: Plan Your Research Methods</h2><p><b>A. Learn From People</b></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Define Your Audience｜Extremes &amp; Mainsteams｜Plan Logistics｜Recruitment Tools｜Create a Trusted Atmosphere</li>
<li><br/></li></li>
<li><b>Pay Attention to the Environment</b></li>
<li>Try to<u> meet in the person’s context</u>—in their home, office, or workplace. This will help you get a better sense of what’s important to them. If you sense the person might be willing, ask for a tour.&nbsp;</li></li>
<li><b>Capture Quotes</b></li>
<li>You’ll have a more accurate record of <u>who the person is—on their terms, in their language</u>.&nbsp;</li></li>
<li><b>Take Photographs&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>Photographs help you remember who you talked to and what you saw, make your research <u>more visual, meaningful, and easier to recall and navigate</u>.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><b>B. Learn From Experts</b></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Expert Interview｜Plan For The Conversation｜Secondary Research&nbsp;</li>
<li>You’ll need<b> more context or history</b> than a typical interview can afford.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><b>C. Immerse Yourself In Context</b></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Plan Your Observations｜Capture What You See｜Reflect on What You’ve Observed</li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>• Map out the different parts of your experience from beginning to end (we call this a “customer journey”).&nbsp;</li>
<li>• How did you feel at different parts of the experience?&nbsp;</li>
<li>• What was unexpected? Challenging? Seamless?</li>
<li><br/></li></ul>
<p><b>D. Analogous Inspiration</b></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Brainstorm Analogous Experiences｜Make Arrangements｜Just Take It In</li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>When helping surgical teams deal with complex procedures, designers looked at how car racing pit-crews optimized their workflow for safety and efficiency.</li>
<li><br/></li></ul style="list-style: none;">
<h2>Step 3: Build Your Interview Guide</h2><p></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Identify Objectives｜Brainstorm Questions｜Organize Your Questions｜Word Questions Strategically｜Use Tangible Conversation Starters｜Confirm Your Plans｜Assign Roles</li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>• <b>Basic</b>: Why are you doing the research? What are you trying find out? Who are you going to talk to or observe? Know that the most valuable part of creating a discussion guide is the thinking that goes into it.&nbsp;</li>
<li>• Make questions <b>easily scannable</b> so you can maintain more eye contact with your interviewee.&nbsp;</li>
<li>•<b> Open General</b>: Gather basic demographics first.&nbsp; For example, if you are designing new savings products, you might ask people to make a list of all of the things they purchased yesterday.</li>
<li>• <b>Go Deep</b>: Ask more profound questions about hopes, fears, and ambitions.&nbsp; For example, if you were working on a project related to saving money, you might ask someone to draw the five big things they’re saving money for over the next ten years and how those things fit into their life goals.</li>
<li>• Frame questions in an <b>open-ended</b> way.&nbsp; “Tell me about an experience …” “What are the best/worst parts about …?” “Can you help me understand about …?”</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Establish Trust With Participants.　</b>Use nonverbal gestures</li>
<li><b>Encourage Participants To Show As Well As Tell.</b>　Draw / Why</li>
<li><b>Know What To Look For.</b> 　Say is different Do / Workarounds</li>
<li><b>Capture What You See.</b>　 see, hear, feel, smell, and taste</li></ul>

<h2>Step 4: Additional Research Methods </h2><p></p><ul><li><b>Personal Diaries</b>　Use this when: You want to get a longer view of a participant’s experience over an extended amount of time.</li>
<li><b>Photo Essays</b>　Use this when: You want to compare and contrast the different daily experiences and realities of a set of participants.</li>
<li><b>Customer Journey</b>　Use this when: You want to discuss a complicated system or series of interactions with a participant. (The process of buying a car is a good example.)</li>
<li><b>Card Sorts</b>　what’s most/least important, interesting, or relevant to them. Ask them talk through their decision process.　Use this when: You want multiple participants to narrow down a set of ideas.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Concept Provocations</b>　Use this when: You want early feedback on why participants like or don’t like certain features</li></ul>

<h2>Step 5: Capture Your Learning</h2><p></p><p>Take Time To Regroup｜Share Your Impressions｜Illustrate New Ideas</p><p></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>• <b>Sound bites:</b> What were the most memorable quotes that people heard? Why were they memorable?&nbsp;</li>
<li>• <b>Interesting stories:</b> What was most surprising to you?&nbsp;</li>
<li>• <b>Interactions:</b> What was interesting about the way he/she interacted with his/her environment?&nbsp;</li>
<li>•<b> Remaining questions:</b> What questions would you like to explore in your next conversation?</li></ul>
