<body><h1>Questions for TechPresident Article</h1><p></p><p>From Sonia Roubini, PDF14 Conference Coordinator and writer for TechPresident.com:</p><p></p><p>The g0v <a href='https://g0v.asia/tw/'/>report</a> states that two problems with using tools such as Facebook as instruments to encourage civic engagement are 1. that online participation doesn&rsquo;t translate into offline action or collaboration, and 2. that a generation gap prevents the online and offline from collaborating.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>Q</b>:<b> Has g0v.tw really worked to solve these problems? If so, how?&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p><p></p><p><b>Q: What does g0v.tw do differently to ensure that social media can actually be a platform for social production and doesn&rsquo;t experience the problems listed above?</b></p><p></p><p><b>Q: How does g0v.tw actually help citizens participate, while social media only makes them feel as though they&rsquo;ve participated?</b></p><p></p><p><b>Q: The report also states that g0v.tw has found a way to combine online and offline activism. What has this meant, practically? It&rsquo;s clear how the &quot;online&quot; collaboration manifests, but what does the community do offline?&nbsp;</b></p><p></p><p><b>Q: g0v.tw is clearly very collaborative. How does the determine which project to undertake?</b></p><p></p><p><b>Q: Is there work done to establish the real needs of citizens before starting work on a project?</b></p><p></p><p></p></body>
