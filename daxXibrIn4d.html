Foodsharing.de is an approach from germany to save food from beeing absurdly wasted. The idea is to go to supermarkets, markets, bakeries and any other food traders shortly before they close and pick up goods the shop would normally dump.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards everybody is free to decide what he wants to do with the stuff he picked up, eat it himself, give it to friends, distribute it to people in need or bring it to the next food bank. It&rsquo;s all about saving food. Nevertheless, picking up and distributing food is subjected to specific legal and social terms and conditions and requires reliable and dedicated people.</p><p></p><p>Multi-saving and sharing platforms such as foodsharing.de are a great opportunity to save resources and shape our life in a more sustainable way.</p><p></p><p>In Taiwan, the translation of German foodsharing documents and the first collaboration to pick up food at a German bakery is on the way now. We will seek more help on this.</p><p></p><p><b>If you require funding for travel, please state the estimated amount here (in USD)</b></p><p></p><p><b>* How do you know about g0v summit ?</b></p><p>From a friend</p><p></p><p><b>* Dietary requirement</b></p><p>vegetarian</p><p></p><p></p></body>
