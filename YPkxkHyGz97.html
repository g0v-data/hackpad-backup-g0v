<body><h1>自己的Emoji自己造</h1><p></p><p></p><h2>提交Emoji提案說明</h2><p>來源：<a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html'/>Unicode Consortium</a></p><p></p><p><b>提交提案</b></p><p></p><p>要提交新的Emoji字提案，請填妥新字提案<a href='http://www.unicode.org/L2/summary.html'/>表單</a>，包含以下資訊，並且依照「<a href='http://www.unicode.org/pending/docsubmit.html'/>如何提交提案文件</a>」進行。</p><p></p><ul><li><br/></li></ul>

<ul><li>A section that addresses selection factors A through I in <a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#selection_factors'/>Selection Factors</a>, and for each one provides evidence as to what degree each of the proposed characters would satisfy that factor.<ul><li>Some factors may not apply, such as <i>A. <a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#Selection_Factors_Compatibility'/>Compatibility</a></i>. If so, explain why.</li>
<li>Details under <i>B. <a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#Selection_Factors_Usage'/>Expected usage level</a></i> must be present, with information as discussed below in <a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#frequency-evidence'/>Evidence of Frequency</a>.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>A set of images for the proposed characters. These are to illustrate how each character might be displayed. See below under <a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#images'/>Images</a>.</li></ul>
<p>Some useful examples are <a href='http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15267r3-food-emoji.pdf'/>food emoji characters</a> and <a href='http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15271r-female-runner.pdf'/>Female Runner</a>. However, all proposals <b><i>must not</i></b> include specific code points (U+XXXXX) for proposed characters; those are determined later based on available positions. The <a href='http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15267r3-food-emoji.pdf'/>food emoji characters</a> was revised after candidate code points were assigned.</p><p></p><p><b>挑選原則</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>Initially, the Unicode emoji characters were selected primarily on the basis of compatibility. The selection factors have been broadened to include other factors; here are the factors that the Emoji Subcommittee now considers when assessing possible new emoji. None of these factors alone determine eligibility or priority: all of the factors together are taken into consideration. The most important factors for inclusion are compatibility and expected usage level.</p><undefined><li><b><i><u>Factors for Inclusion</u></i></b></li></undefined>
<ul><li><a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#Selection_Factors_Compatibility'/>Compatibility</a>.<i> Are these needed for compatibility with high-use emoji in existing systems, such as Gmail?</i><ul><li>For example,&nbsp; FACE WITH ROLLING EYES.</li>
<li>There are many cases where characters are or have been added for compatibility alone, such as SQUARED NEW, or&nbsp; CONSTRUCTION WORKER. In such cases, this is an overriding factor.</li></ul>
</li>
<li><a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#Selection_Factors_Usage'/>Expected usage level</a>. <i>(See questions below)</i> Measures that can be presented as evidence include the following:<ul><li><u>Frequency</u><i>. Is there a high expected frequency of use?</i><ul><li>This is the most important factor for inclusion, after compatibility.</li>
<li>There should be high expected usage worldwide, or high expected usage within a particular community of users (such as Indonesians).</li></ul>
</li>
<li><u>Multiple usages</u><i>. Does the candidate emoji have notable metaphorical references or symbolism?</i><ul><li>For example,&nbsp; SHARK is not necessarily only the animal, but also used for a huckster, in jumping the shark, card shark, loan shark, etc.</li>
<li>This factor particularly applies to animal emoji with references in stereotypes, metaphorical use, and symbolism in sources such as Wikipedia.</li></ul>
</li>
<li><u>Emotional Content</u><i>. Does the candidate emoji evoke emotions such as happiness, sadness, excitement, fear, anger, or other emotions?</i><ul><li>For example,&nbsp; CAT FACE,&nbsp; PIG FACE, or&nbsp; RABBIT FACE may evoke positive feelings, while SPIDER may evoke negative feelings.</li></ul>
</li>
<li><u>Persistence</u><i>. Is the expected level of usage likely to continue into the future, or would it just be a fad?</i><ul><li>Transient or faddish symbols are poor candidates for encoding.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li><a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#Selection_Factors_Distinctive'/>Image distinctiveness</a>. <i>Is there a clearly recognizable image of a physical object that could serve as a paradigm, one that would be distinct enough from other emoji?</i><ul><li>For example, CASSOULET or STEW probably couldn’t be easily distinguished from&nbsp; POT OF FOOD.</li>
<li>Simple words (“NEW”) or abstract symbols (“∰”) would not qualify as emoji.</li>
<li>Note that objects often may represent activities or modifiers, such as CRYING FACE for <i>crying</i> or RUNNER for <i>running</i>.</li></ul>
</li>
<li><a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#Selection_Factors_Completeness'/>Completeness</a>. <i>Does the proposed pictograph fill a gap in existing types of emoji?</i><ul><li>In Unicode 8.0, for example, five emoji were added to complete the zodiac, including&nbsp; SCORPION.</li></ul>
</li>
<li><a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#Selection_Factors_Requested'/>Frequently requested</a>. <i>Is it often requested of the Unicode Consortium, or of Unicode member companies?</i><ul><li>For example,&nbsp; HOT DOG or&nbsp; UNICORN.</li>
<li>Petitions are only considered as possible indications of potential frequency of usage, among the other selection factors.<ul><li>Citations of petition results should provide evidence as how reliable the petition mechanism is (in terms of preventing duplicates or robovotes) and account to what extent the results could be skewed by commercial promotion of the petition.</li>
<li>There is a misperception that such petitions play a large role in selecting emoji. For example, the commercial petitions for&nbsp; TACO played no part in its selection, because there was no evidence of reliability.</li></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<undefined><li><b><i><u>Factors for Exclusion</u></i></b></li></undefined>
<ul><li><a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#Specific'/>Overly specific</a>. <i>Is the proposed character overly specific?</i><ul><li>For example,&nbsp; SUSHI represents sushi in general, although images frequently show a specific type, such as Maguro. Adding SABA, HAMACHI, SAKE, AMAEBI and others would be overly specific.</li></ul>
</li>
<li><a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#Selection_Factors_Open'/>Open-ended</a>. <i>Is it just one of many, with no special reason to favor it over others of that type?</i><ul><li>For example, there are thousands of occupations (DOCTOR, DENTIST, JANITOR, POLITICIAN, etc.) — is there a special reason to favor particular ones of them?</li></ul>
</li>
<li><a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#Selection_Factors_Representable'/>Already Representable</a>. <i>Can the concept be represented by another emoji or sequence?</i><ul><li>For example, a <i>crying baby</i> can already be represented by&nbsp; CRYING FACE + BABY</li>
<li>A building associated with a particular religion might be represented by a&nbsp; PLACE OF WORSHIP emoji followed by a one of the many religious symbols in Unicode.</li>
<li>Halloween could be represented by either just&nbsp; JACK-O-LANTERN, or a sequence of&nbsp;&nbsp; JACK-O-LANTERN + GHOST.</li></ul>
</li>
<li><a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#Selection_Factors_Inappropriate'/>Logos, brands, UI icons, signage, specific people, deities</a>. <i>Are the images unsuitable for encoding as characters?</i><ul><li>Images such as company logos, or those showing company brands as part or all of the image</li>
<li>UI icons such as <a href='https://github.com/google/material-design-icons#material-design-icons'/>Material Design Icons</a>, <a href='https://github.com/winjs/winjs/tree/master/src/fonts#symbolsttf'/>Winjs Icons</a>, or <a href='https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome#font-awesome-v420'/>Font Awesome Icons</a>, which are often discarded or modified to meet evolving UI needs</li>
<li>Signage such as . See also Slate’s <i><a href='http://www.slate.com/articles/life/signs/2010/03/the_big_red_word_vs_the_little_green_man.html'/>The Big Red Word vs. the Little Green Man</a></i></li>
<li>Specific people, whether historic or living</li>
<li>Deities</li></ul>
</ul>
<p>Note that symbols used in signage or user interfaces may be encoded in Unicode for reasons unconnected with their use as emoji.</p><p>(A previous version of this section was in <a href='http://unicode.org/reports/tr51/#Selection_Factors'/>UTR #51, Annex C</a>.)</p><p></p><p><b>使用頻率證明</b></p><p></p><p><a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#frequency-evidence'/>Evidence of Frequency</a></p><p>Different techiques can be used as evidence that the proposed emoji character is likely to be be widely used. The basic goal is to establish the expected frequency of usage compared to a commonly-used emoji of the same type. Thus for a proposed&nbsp; HOT DOG emoji, one can compare against an existing emoji for another food item,&nbsp; HAMBURGER. The <i>relative</i> frequency is the important information.</p><p>Here are some examples of services you can use. These are not the only methods that can be used as evidence of expected frequency, but proposals should not “cherry-pick”. That is, don&rsquo;t pick only the data that favors the proposed character—present all the available evidence you can find.</p><p>Google Trends</p><ul><li>Compare related terms using “Image Search”</li>
<li>Example: search <a href='https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=hamburger%2C%20hot%20dog&amp;gprop=images&amp;cat=0-71'/>hot dog vs hamburger</a>, to get two figures (eg, 55 and 66), and divide to get 83%</li></ul>
<p>Instagram</p><ul><li>Compare related items with separate searches for hashtagged items</li>
<li>Example: perform two searchs for <a href='https://instagram.com/explore/tags/hotdog/'/>hotdog</a> and then <a href='https://instagram.com/explore/tags/hamburger/'/>hamburger</a>, to get two figures (eg, 1.3M and 1M), and divide to get 130%</li></ul>
<p>Remember to try related words, both “burger” and “hamburger&quot;, for example. It may also be useful to try different languages, such as “paella” vs “hamburguesa”.</p><p></p><p><b>圖片</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Images must be in PNG format with dimensions of at least 72x72 pixels and no more than 144x144 pixels. The image should extend to the sides of the cell (ie, no extra padding).</li>
<li>The file names must have the following format:</li></ul>
<ul class="code"><li>proposed_&lt;hex&gt;.png</li><ul><li>Where &lt;hex&gt; is a lowercase hex value from e000 to f8ff (private use), such as proposed_e000.png</li>
<li>For a sequence, there will be more than one &lt;hex&gt; value, all separated by _, such as proposed_e000_e031.png</li>
<li>Once a character is accepted, then “proposed” should be changed to a vendor name, and the code point’s hex values used instead of private use codes, such as apple_1f915.png.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>They must be licensed so they can be used on the Unicode site, such as “public domain”, “licensed for non-commercial use”, “free to share and use”, or equivalent (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license'/>CC</a>: CC0, or BY*). Include a link to a page indicating the license.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If possible, also supply a black and white image, in the style used by the Unicode charts. For examples, see <a href='http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html'/>Full Emoji Data</a>.</li>
<li><i>Image Search</i> (or equivalent) can be useful for finding suitable images.<ul><li>On <a href='http://www.bing.com/?scope=images'/>Bing</a>, choose <i>Type&gt;Clipart</i></li>
<li>On <a href='https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=isch'/>Google</a>, choose <i>Search Tools&gt;Type&gt;Clipart</i></li>
<li>You can try filtering for usage rights or license. Sometimes that’s too narrow, and you can find more images with a general search, clicking through to determine the license.</li></ul>
