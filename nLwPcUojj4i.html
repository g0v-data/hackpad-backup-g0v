<h2>What is HCD?</h2><ul><li><b>What Can the Approach Be Used For?</b></li>
<li><b>The Design Process:</b> Inspiration, Ideation, Implementation</li>
<li><b>7 Mindsets</b></li></ul>

<p>Design thinkers look for work-arounds and improvise solutions and find ways to in- corporate those into the offerings they create. they consider what we call the edges, the places where “extreme” people live differently, think differently, and consume differently.</p><p></p><h2>Local Experience</h2><p></p><p><b>Shanti and Naandi treatment center</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Malnutrition in Veitnam</b></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>The Sternins and colleagues from Save the Children surveyed four local Quong Xuong communities in the province of Than Hoa and asked for examples of <b>“very, very poor” families</b> whose children were healthy. They then observed the food preparation, cooking, and serving behaviors of these six families, called “positive deviants,” and found a few consistent yet rare behaviors. <u>Parents of well-nourished children collected tiny shrimps, crabs, and snails from rice paddies and added them to the food, along with the greens from sweet potatoes. Although these foods were readily available, they were typically not eaten because they were considered unsafe for children. The positive deviants also fed their children multiple smaller meals, which allowed small stomachs to hold and digest more food each day.</u></li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>The Sternins and the rest of their group worked with the positive deviants to offer cooking classes to the families of children suffering from malnutrition. By the end of the program’s first year, 80 percent of the 1,000 children enrolled in the program were adequately nourished. In addition, the effort had been replicated within 14 villages across Vietnam.</li></ul>

<p><b>Mosquito Nets in Ghana</b></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>One program that might have benefited from design thinking is mosquito net distribution in Africa. The nets are well designed and when used are effective at reducing the incidence of malaria.&nbsp; The World Health Organization praised the nets, crediting them with significant drops in malaria deaths in children under age 5: a 51 percent decline in Ethiopia, 34 percent decline in Ghana, and 66 percent decline in Rwanda.6 The way that the mosquito nets have been distributed, however, has had unintended consequences.&nbsp; <u>In northern Ghana, for instance, nets are provided free to pregnant women and mothers with children under age 5. These women can readily pick up free nets from local public hospitals. For everyone else, however, the nets are difficult to obtain.</u> When we asked a well-educated Ghanaian named Albert, who had recently contracted malaria, whether he slept under a mosquito net, he told us no—there was no place in the city of Tamale to purchase one. <u>Because so many people can obtain free nets, it is not profitable for shop owners to sell them. But hospitals are not equipped to sell additional nets, either.</u></li>
<li>As Albert’s experience shows, it’s critical that the people designing a program consider not only form and function, but distribution</li>
<li>channels as well.</li></ul>

<h2>The Origin of Design Thinking </h2><p>By 2001, ideo was increasingly being asked to tackle problems that seemed far afield from traditional design. A health care foundation asked us to help restructure its organization, a century-old manufacturing company wanted to better understand its clients, and a university hoped to create alternative learning environments to traditional classrooms. <u>This type of work took IDEO from designing consumer products to designing consumer experiences.</u></p><p>The design thinking process is best thought of as <b>a system of overlapping spaces</b> rather than a sequence of orderly steps. There are three spaces to keep in mind: <i>inspiration</i>, <i>ideation</i>, and <i>implementation</i>. Think of <i>inspiration</i> as the problem or opportunity that motivates the search for solutions; <i>ideation</i> as the process of generating, developing, and testing ideas; and <i>implementation</i> as the path that leads from the project stage into people’s lives. <u>The reason to call these spaces, rather than steps, is that they are not always undertaken sequentially.</u>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>Inspiration-Rwanda</b></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>A better starting point is for designers to go out into the world and observe the actual experiences of smallholder farmers, school- children, and community health workers as they improvise their way through their daily lives. Working with local partners who serve as interpreters and cultural guides is also important, as well as having partners make introductions to communities, helping build credibil- ity quickly and ensuring understanding. Through “homestays” and shadowing locals at their jobs and in their homes, design thinkers become embedded in the lives of the people they are designing for.</li>

<li>Because Pecknold didn’t speak the women’s language, <u>she asked them to document their lives and aspirations with a camera and draw pictures that expressed what success looked like in their community.</u> Through these activities, <b>the women were able to see for themselves what was important and valuable</b>, rather than having an outsider make those assumptions for them. During the project, Pecknold also provided each participant with the equivalent of a day’s wages (500 francs, or roughly $1) to see what each person did with the money. Doing this gave her further insight into the people’s lives and aspirations. Meanwhile, the women found that a mere 500 francs a day could be a significant, life- changing sum. This visualization process helped both Pecknold and the women prioritize their planning for the community.</li></ul>

<p><b>Ideation-InnoCentive</b></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>InnoCentive provides a good example of how design thinking can result in hundreds of ideas. <u>InnoCentive has created a Web site that allows people to post solutions to challenges that are defined</u> <u>by InnoCentive members, a mix of nonprofits and companies.</u> More than 175,000 people—including scientists, engineers, and designers from around the world—have posted solutions.</li></ul>

<p><b>Implementation-VisionSpring</b></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>VisionSpring, a low-cost eye care provider in India, provides a good example of how prototyping can be a critical step in imple- mentation. VisionSpring, which had been selling reading glasses to adults, wanted to begin providing comprehensive eye care to chil- dren. <u>VisionSpring’s design effort included everything</u> <i><u>other than</u></i><u> the design of the glasses, from marketing “eye camps” through self-help</u> <u>groups to training teachers about the importance of eye care and transporting kids to the local eye care center.</u></li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>Working with VisionSpring, ideo designers prototyped the eye- screening process with <b>a group of 15 children</b> between the ages of 8 and 12. The designers first tried to screen a young girl’s vision through traditional tests. Immediately, though, she burst into tears— the pressure of the experience was too great and the risk of failure too high. In hopes of diffusing this stressful situation, the design- ers asked the children’s teacher to screen the next student. Again, the child started to cry. The designers then asked the girl to screen her teacher. She took the task very seriously, while <b>her classmates looked on enviously</b>. Finally, the designers had the children screen each other and talk about the process. <b>They loved playing doctor and both respected and complied with the process.</b></li></ul>
