Dis-incentivises participation.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In a movement building like in open source, your social capital is your only capital. Your people are your only asset, and how you manage it will determine your success rate.</p><p></p><p>Even when people agree that they need to agree, they suck at it.</p><p></p><p>Substance/relationship tension: binary choice between relationship between people and outcome of conversation (e.g. stronger relationship = less factually correct outcome).&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Different groups stabilise in different quadrants, the aim is to stabilise in the upper right quadrant, where you can be confident that a relationship is strong enough to withstand any substance. When you&rsquo;re operating in that quadrant, you&rsquo;d never call it a negotiation. Calling something a &rsquo;negotiation&rsquo; is a symbol that you have predetermined that it is likely to go wrong. It sets you up for failure.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Exercise: people pair up, no talking, given partial rules of a game, 10 seconds to earn points. People recognise the game as &rsquo;arm wrestling&rsquo;, but it is never explicitly named, and yet we still bring the default behaviours of arm wrestling with us.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The same goes for negotiation, we have partial rules and default behaviours. The only solution is to find an effective means of communication. (Consequently power accumulates in those that are most effective communicators.)</p><p></p><p>A common pattern in conflict resolution is &quot;I did something nice to them last week and they spat on us, now it is all on them to make reparations.&quot; It may take 2 or 3 attempts at concession before the notion is effectively transmitted, as the first response you got was just a reflex.</p><p></p><p>This is why it is so fundamentally important that groups of diverse people getting clear alignment of their goals, because the default behaviours and partial communication problem can very rapidly corrupt the original purpose.</p><p></p><p>You can come to a negotiation with different assumptions e.g &quot;the other person is stupid/crazy/evil&quot; vs &quot;they are doing what they believe to be in their best interest&quot;. Different assumptions can be either debilitating or empowering.</p><p></p><p>Traditional positional bargaining: start from extreme positions, make small concessions and threats, and eventually make enough concessions to get to a deal. This model is based on lying: &rsquo;yesterday I said I can only make this concession, but today I actually can make more concessions.&rsquo; If your opponent sees that you are lying, they can rationally assume that your &rsquo;final word&rsquo; is not the final word. E.g. you can always assume the opening offer is the start of a negotiation position that will eventually result in further concessions.</p><p></p><p>Interpersonal interaction models don&rsquo;t scale effectively, but culture can. e.g. When you&rsquo;re starting an open source project, you can establish a healthy culture in the early days, that can then scale up as the project grows.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Better model: Interests | Options | Legitimacy</p><p></p><p>Rather than thinking &rsquo;what is the demand&rsquo;, think about &rsquo;what motivates them, what do they care about, what do I care about&rsquo; - that is what we&rsquo;re actually negotiation about: different parties getting their needs met. If you can establish the interests of the other party (&quot;What do you want?&quot;), you&rsquo;re much more likely to get to a mutually beneficial resolution.</p><p></p><p>This works well when it is fuelled by a relationship (e.g. a sense of mutual respect) and effective communication.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Big communities have big interpersonal problems. Need to establish strong relationships and effective communication protocols at the outset of any project. Without it, whenever there&rsquo;s a negotiation, it will frequently result in people going to alternatives (e.g. I will leave), and much less likely to commit to something constructive (I will stay).</p><p></p><p>Increasing the frequency of interactions is one way to improve the likelihood of positive negotiations, e.g. I get to learn to trust you over time.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>A mediator&rsquo;s job is to work on the relationship and communication, to establish a healthy foundation from which to start a productive negotiation of interests.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>總結 Conclusions</b></p><p>(海報照片 photo of your poster)</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>#3 13:30 - 14:10 主題 Topic: Organising without bosses</h2><p>現場直播網址 live url、錄影紀錄網址 video url、照片紀錄網址 photos url</p><p>參與者 Contributors: (請簽名 sign here)</p><p>發表者 Present by: Rich Bartlett from <a href='https://loomio.org'/>Loomio</a> (<a href='https://twitter.com/richdecibels'/>@richdecibels</a>)</p><p></p><p>Transitioning from a swarm to a coherent organisation without compromising on principles of radically participatory democracy.</p><p></p><undefined><li><b>Scenario:</b></li></undefined>
<p>Loomio crowdfunded $130k (USD), made some promises for what will be delivered and when it will be delivered. This &rsquo;scare resource&rsquo; needs to be divided equitably between a diversity of stakeholders. So we are developing a framework + processes + roles + tactics to solve this dilemma, relatively happily (so far so good!)</p><p></p><undefined><li><b>Framework:</b></li></undefined>

<ol><li><b>Purpose: </b>Why do we exist, what are our goals? Write it down!&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Principles: </b>How do we want to behave? Slightly more dynamic and flexible.</li>
<li><b>Priorities</b>: What do we want to achieve in a given timeframe with given resources?&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Programs: </b>How can we group those distinct tasks into coherent work programs?</li>
<li><b>People: </b>Who is the best person to perform these tasks?&nbsp;</li></ol>

<undefined><li><b>Process:</b></li></undefined>

<p>The purpose is set in stone so it needs to be established by long slow consensus: everyone needs to love it.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The principles are slightly more dynamic and flexible, they evolve over time.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The priorities change every X months: which part of vision do we want to achieve in that time?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>All members participate in a collaborative process to establish the relative priorities between programs, like participatory budgeting: we have $100k or 200hrs to spend on these programs, how would you split it up? Diversity of opinion at this point exposes where there is incomplete information - focus your energy on developing further shared understanding.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>It&rsquo;s important to establish all this groundwork before deciding who should do what job, otherwise you are just hiring based on social hierarchy. Instead, want to find what are the actual needs of the project and who is best positioned to meet them. Tradeoff between selecting specialists and generalists.</p><p></p><undefined><li><b>Roles</b></li></undefined>
<p>Contributor: someone making tangible improvements to the project, voluntary or paid</p><p>Member: someone who has been contributing &gt; 1 year, invited by consensus of the other members.&nbsp;</p><p></p><undefined><li><b>Tactics</b></li></undefined>
<p>Every work program has a stated <b>outcome</b> (e.g. &quot;engaged and growing userbase&quot;) + a <b>coordinator</b> (person who knows the status of all the tasks, and interfaces with other work programs to ensure alignment) + a <b>budget</b> (as allocated by the members).</p><p></p><p><b>Hiring</b> is done by a panel composed of the coordinator + an expert (internal or external) + any member that has an interest.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>Delegations</b> are temporary and retractable, e.g. coordinators are reaffirmed every 3 months. Any member can veto anything. All work programs are as transparent as possible, and as participatory as makes sense (e.g. the <a href='https://loomio.org/roadmap'/>Loomio roadmap</a> is public, and the <a href='https://loomio.org/community'/>Loomio Community</a> helps set strategy).</p><p></p><p><b>All Hands Meeting</b> - same time and place every week, open to anyone interested in the project, creates collective identity, converts interested people into contributors and then members.</p><p></p><p><b>Check-ins</b>: start most meetings with a round where we hear from everyone - &rsquo;how do you feel? what&rsquo;s on your mind?&rsquo;. Creates &rsquo;politica afectiva&rsquo; - people relate to each other with affection, the care about each other = strong relationships. Also safe space to challenge strategy (&rsquo;I feel anxious that we made some bad decisions...&rsquo;). Gives everyone space to practice self-expression, which is first fundamental skill of real democracy.</p><p></p><p><b>Conflict resolution</b> - every contributor/member must have direct line of communication to every other contributor/member. Creates immunity to informal hierarchy. If we see one of those lines weakening due to some conflict/tension, immediately mobilise to resolve it and reestablish healthy communication.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Peer support: every member has a <b>steward</b>, and they are a steward to someone else too. Stewards provide accountability + support that you would normally get from a boss.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>helps to orient newcomers (any questions - ask your steward)</li>
<li>resolve conflict (your steward is always on your side)</li>
<li>professional development (like a life coach, informal meeting where you discuss what you want to achieve, and periodically review personal goals )</li></ul>
