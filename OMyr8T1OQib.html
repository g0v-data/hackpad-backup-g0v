<body><h1>safewords</h1><p>Good morning!</p><p>I hope you&rsquo;re dealing well with the heat in Hungary!</p><p>@LaReinaSofia and I were discussing safewords a few days ago. We&rsquo;ve never played and it&rsquo;s unlikely we ever will, but we have our safeword now. It&rsquo;s as personal as you&rsquo;d like for your collection.</p><p>It&rsquo;s ‘dusaristotókeia’ (with a rising tone at the ó). It&rsquo;s a word that appears just once in Homer&rsquo;s Iliad and means something utterly untranslatable like ‘unhappy mother of the noblest son’.</p><p>The background: Sofia and I were walking around Athens when we first met, discussing languages and how compact Ancient Greek could get. She used this one as an example. I never forgot it, and she remembered it two — 12 years later.</p><p></p></body>
