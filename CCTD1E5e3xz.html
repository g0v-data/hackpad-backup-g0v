<body><h1>(g0v@Stanford Talk) Fork and Merge an Open Government: Experiments of g0v in Taiwan</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Title:&nbsp; Fork and Merge an Open Government: Experiments of g0v in Taiwan (tentative)</p><p>Date: 10/30/2016 Sun&nbsp;</p><p>Time: TBD</p><p>Location: TBD, Stanford University, Stanford, CA&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>Abstract</b></p><p>The g0v.tw (gov-zero Taiwan) is a civic tech community that pushes information transparency, focusing on developing platforms and tools for citizens to participate in society and the processes of government decision-making. Substituting the &quot;o&quot; with &quot;0&quot; in gov, g0v not only stands for rethinking the role that the government plays from the bottom up, but also represents the world view of 0 and 1 in the digital natives generation. Founded in 2012, g0v grew to 1000+ contributors within 18 months, with a mix of 40% developer, 30% designer, and 30% activists/officials from government. Taiwan also topped the <a href='http://index.okfn.org/place/'/>OKFN Open Data Index</a> in 2015 as one of the most vibrant civic tech communities in the world. g0v has pushed for open government data, and helped the government draft the Open-Definition-compliant <a href='http://data.gov.tw/license#eng'/>Open Government Data License</a>. We are happy to invite Kriby Wu (co-founder of g0v), YuRen Ju (active participant of g0v) and Min­Husan Wu (g0v participant &amp; deputy-CEO of Open Culture Foundation) to share their experiences of civic hacking.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>Agenda</b></p><p>Opening (5 min)&nbsp;</p><p>Kriby Wu (20 min):&nbsp; Introduction of g0v and which projects??&nbsp;</p><p>Yuren Ju (20 min): Experiences of g0v and which projects??</p><p>MinHusan Wu (20 min): Introduction of OCF&rsquo;s vision and the civic tech week 2017</p><p>QA (25 min)</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Speakers</h2><ul style="list-style: none;"><li><b>Kirby Wu (吳泰輝) / g0v co-founder</b></li>
