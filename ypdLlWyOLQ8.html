<p>============================↓ Live Broadcast Below =========================</p><p></p><p>(All Time GMT+8) <a href='/ypdLlWyOLQ8'/>English Version</a></p><p></p><p><b>March 23, 2014</b></p><p></p><p>04:58 (Conference Hall) All the door keepers for 8th door and order maintainers please meet at 8th door for discussing work distribution.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>04:34 (Conference Hall) Announcement about the lesson in the morning. (voice unclear, to be supplemented)</p><p></p><p>04:21 (Conference Hall) [broadcast] There are some fruits here. Whoever wants it can come and pick up.</p><p></p><p>04:21 (Conference Hall) Would all of the volunteers defending door no. 8 please meet at door no. 8 to discuss division of duties?</p><p></p><p>03:55 (Jinan Rd.) [host] OK! Now last one. The salary-man Mr. Liao(?) previously really wanted to lead everyone to yell a slogan, but he was too excited and went off the stage. So I am gonna help him (disconnected) Let&rsquo;s do it, I do the first part, and you do the second part. &rsquo;The government is dead, long live democracy!!!&rsquo; Well, so we today... Yue-shu (? sounds like this) hasn&rsquo;t arrived yet? OK, no problem. So the activities on the stage shall end now for today, so everyone can take a rest. Thank you everyone, thank you for willing to (disconnected, to be continued)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:5? (Jinan Rd.) Mr Wang: I don&rsquo;t think we can do anything under this circumstance. Or let&rsquo;s say, he just needs to announce that the parliament meeting takes place in some other locations, and then our action of occupying the parliament becomes meaningless. So in my opinion, we should fortify our mind, be prepared for facing another stronger conflict. Second, I don&rsquo;t think we should focus on criticizing President Ma as an individual or whatever mistakes he made about the deer&rsquo;s horns. We should focus on KMT as an organization. This time President Ma made this service and trade agreement, but have you seen Lien Shen-Wen saying a thing? How about Ju Li-Luen and Wu Dun-Yi? The high level officers in KMT seemed to be neglecting it, so we should focus on attacking about the interests structure of KMT.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:50 (Jinan Rd. ) [host] We are now trying to find... Student Wang, if you hear this, please come to the backstage. The next one is a salary man Mr. Wang from Tao-yuan wanting to share with everyone. How long have you been here? [Mr. Wang] It&rsquo;s the third day. (disconnected, to be supplemented)</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>03:2? (Jinan Rd.) [teacher] I really feel, when justice is not preserved for future generations, the people that criticizes students who go to the site are not studying, they should really come and see why the next generation came to the Legislative Yuan instead of studying? I feel like they are defending their own generation, and I believe justice can be preserved, thanks everyone! I think everyone hopes the rich can donate money while others donate time and effort, send the sunflowers here. I really think (signal lost)</p><p></p><p>03:22 (Jinan Rd.) [cram school teacher] Friends, good evening everybody! I am a teacher at a cram school. I came over at midnight and went back at six am. This morning, most of my students were elementary schoolers. They asked me &quot;Where did you go yesterday that you&rsquo;re so without energy today?&quot; I said I went to the Legislative Yuan. They asked me, &quot;Isn&rsquo;t that a student affair?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I said, &quot;Your older classmates, my students, they&rsquo;re at the assembly hall. If my students hadn&rsquo;t been at the assembly hall, I wouldn&rsquo;t have known to go.&quot;&nbsp; I told them about the trade pact (signal lost) but they won&rsquo;t understand what a trade pact is, so I told them something like this: Today, your older schoolmates are defending justice for this generation.&nbsp; When the previous generations give a broken Taiwan to you, will you resign yourselves to accepting this kind of Taiwan? If justice is not preserved for future generations, you can endure (disconnected, to be continued)</p><p></p><p>03:20 (Jinan Rd.) [host] Earlier, I mistakenly blamed the physics student, but it&rsquo;s actually that our mic is almost out of power.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s here celebrating his birthday with everyone. Thank you! Now, there&rsquo;s a cram school teacher, she prepared a bunch of sunflowers and brought them here for everyone. Thank you!&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:15 (Jinan Rd.) [Lee Yen-Jung lawyer] Hello everyone at the site! (Hello) Everyone is very loud, it is March 23rd at 3:20am, and today, March 23rd, is actually my birthday, I am very happy today that I can spend the first three hours of my birthday with everyone! My birthday wish is: revoke CSSTA! (lost signal) Is everyone ready? Revoke CSSTA!! Protect democracy! Revoke CSSTA! Protect democracy! I am so moved everyone is so supportive even at 3:30am! The next statement represent my own views and does not represent Awakening Foundation; What I want to say is, (lost signal) democracy&rsquo;s bottomline, if we do not come out and oppose this, everyone has different opinion on CSSTA&rsquo;s content, but the problem with the legislative procedure is a defect, it is a great constitutionalism crisis, we cannot allow KMT to trample Taiwan&rsquo;s democracy! Our predecessors shed blood to overthrow the Qing dynasty and established a democratic nation, we must not give it up lightly; therefore at March 23rd, 3:22am, please give yourselves some applause ok! (applause) I believe, at the moment, everyone is not very clear on the next step, but everyone here is making a contribution to Taiwan&rsquo;s democracy. Spending time with everyone on my birthday at 3:30am, thank you everyone, thank you!</p><p></p><p>03:14 (Jinan Rd.) [host] Ok, after the mic lesson it&rsquo;s louder right. Backstage gave me a [global update], the content is:&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>White House petition has surpassed ten thousand signature threshold! (Applause) (Subsequent explanations on petition, number of supporters) So no matter at New York, Chicago, LA or Paris, all of them have working and studying Taiwanese people, holding support events. USA, UK, Germany, Japan, France, Edinburgh all have them! So we should work harder here, right? The next friend, everyone at the back says she is the star today, ok, that&rsquo;s you! Let us welcome, representing Awakening Foundation, Lee Yen-Jung lawyer!</p><p></p><p>03:13 (Jinan Rd.) [Student Chang Jun-ming] That really nervous person, he&rsquo;s now online ... I admire a singer, called Chang Hsuan, he&rsquo;s really short.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m saying he&rsquo;s not tall, but he speaks really distinctly, he&rsquo;s really fluent. His gentle strength makes me think of Taiwan&rsquo;s gentle strength. In class, our teachers say that we&rsquo;re too young, that we can&rsquo;t judge between right and wrong, and we should wait until we grow up to come back. But regarding this kind of talk, I have a thought.&nbsp; When Chang Ai-ling was my age, she wrote &quot;My Dream of Genius,&quot; the founder of Facebook was only 18 when he founded it.&nbsp; The physics department at NTU is also to same, recently there was a new invention, and it was an alumnus of NTU&rsquo;s physics department who invented it (signal lost) Once, there was a great person, and he lived through...</p><p></p><p>[Host]: Sorry, but there are students in the back who say that they can&rsquo;t hear you and they&rsquo;d really like to hear what you&rsquo;re saying, so I&rsquo;m going to give you a lesson in using a mic.&nbsp; Pretend you&rsquo;re A-mei. Great, continue.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>[Student Chang]: The reason that Jesus is mighty is because he lived, then he died, and then he rose again.&nbsp; If he didn&rsquo;t wake up, that is, be resurrected, then he wouldn&rsquo;t have been Jesus Christ. We once asked for democracy, but then the KMT exercised single party autocracy, eventually politics took shape to follow the will of the people and there was alternation of political parties.&nbsp; Now, it&rsquo;s changed to the Ma government in power, and now we once again want to take back our democracy. This is like love. Only when you&rsquo;ve lost your democracy do you understand how important democracy is. And similarly... (signal lost)&nbsp;  </p><p></p><p>It should&nbsp; be China that fears us. Taiwan is an odd country. They should take note of Taiwan, which has lost ninety nine percent of its territory and yet has not been destroyed.  We should use this thing called democracy to go unify China.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:12 [Jinan] (host) The next one is a young friend, student Chang Jun-ming. He&rsquo;s a freshman majoring Physics in NTU. Please applaud.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:11 (Jinan) Because some friends have shared with us that they want to rest, so we are going to have only five more friends to share with us.&nbsp; After they&rsquo;ve spoken, we&rsquo;ll turn off the mic.&nbsp; If other friends have things to say, we&rsquo;ll continue at 6am.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:10 (Jinan) [Host] Didn&rsquo;t you just tell me that you&rsquo;re shy? And your meaning is? I feel as if I&rsquo;ve been tricked! (joke)  Let&rsquo;s thank them with a round of applause.   Earlier, I expected a hymn, or something with a harmonious, peaceful feeling, I never thought that I&rsquo;d feel this HIGH!&nbsp; (trans. note: colloquial for energized)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:08 (Jinan) spring: I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;m a bit nervous.&nbsp; I hope everyone can continue to support this. Even though hearing about this news doesn&rsquo;t put us in a very good mood, we must confront it peacefully, so I hope everyone can continue to press on.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Finally, because I am a Christian, this hymn originally had a different ending, but I rewrote it to be about Taiwan resurrecting. I hope that at the last line, everyone can join with me to sing &quot;Taiwan ressurrected&quot;, ok?&nbsp; (OK!) Thanks everyone!</p><p></p><p>03:06 (Jinan) Host: Thanks Xiao You. Friends you don&rsquo;t know what transgender is right? Transgenders are only 10% of the population, but it&rsquo;s not only these 10% that contains homosexual and bisexual (missing transcript) globalization easiest to lose (missing transcript) after the Japanese nuclear accident, homosexual group released a report saying: Japan&rsquo;s subsequent evacuation plans and response plans did not consider the needs for homosexual groups and transgender mates, so it is easy to be sacrificed during the evacuation. Every homosexual friend, is it not because of freedom and democracy, that you are able to stand on the street and say you want to marry? Impossible, very difficult.&nbsp; Today there are a lot of homosexual friends in Taiwan, they (lost signal) earn money, open small businesses, open breakfast shops, be SOHO group, she can use her artistic skills to open a studio. Today the CSSTA passes, then a lot of homosexual friends probably cannot be themselves, they can only repress themselves and go work for a big corporation; homosexual and CSSTA actually have a lot of connections. Today a lot of friends wants to give their blessings online, everyone knows if CSSTA passes, the biggest impact is on the hair and beauty industry. Next, there is a friend working in hair and beauty, his name is spring, he would like to sing a hymn for everyone. He said he is a very shy person, but he would still like to sing a hymn to encourage everyone.</p><p></p><p>02:57 (Jinan) Xiao You: Hi everyone, I am Xiao You. I am an office worker. I came here on the first night, but I had to work on Wednesday, so I left at midnight. I came here again on Wednesday, but I left again because I had to work on Thursday. Then on Friday night, I stayed here; there was information saying that it may be more risky that night, so I stayed overnight, and went to work directly the next day. On Friday night I also stayed overnight here, and tonight I am staying overnight here as well. Tomorrow I will also be here and then go to work directly on Monday.&nbsp; Why do I do this? Because I feel we all have different identity for ourselves, why did I ask the host not to introduce me, because I am a male to female transgender. I consider myself female, do you all consider yourselves Taiwanese or Chinese? (Taiwanese)&nbsp; Regardless of your posts in life at a company or a school... (missing transcript)... My mother called and asked me: are you at the site? Do you have anything you want to say? I don&rsquo;t have anything to say because I am going to the site now. My mother is very deep blue on the political spectrum... (missing transcript)... What is respect, I am a Christian at the same time, earlier it was trending to say Christian... (missing transcript) but they cannot enjoy marriage, is this respect? We joke and say this is bad language, (lost?) I have xxx friends but this and that, I feel respect is not saying what kind of friends I have, but is us having different stances, and still being able to listen to what others say and communicate our beliefs with others. Because I respect my co-workers&rsquo; different stances, and can communicate with them. Most of my friends&rsquo; co-workers are now against non-transparent service and trade agreement, thanks everyone.</p><p></p><p>02:57 [Jinan] (host) Thank this 18-year-old student. He/she is very brave. The next friend is special, she&rsquo;s a friend who I&rsquo;ve known for long. She has been supporting here for quite some days. Welcome Xiao You!</p><p></p><p>02:53 [Jinan] Student from Yen-ping senior high school: actually I&rsquo;ve been watching this for several days. And I got to know some medical students from NTU on internet. Actually I am kind of harvesting the fruits of their work here. I talked to my classmates later. And they asked me, &rsquo;why do you come here? you such a 609.&rsquo; Ok, I shut up. I am not even 036. I cannot vote yet. But those 10 classmates, now my strongest supporters, they were too shy to come, so they sent me as a representative here. Yesterday I came, but only stayed for 2 hours and I went home. I told my mom that I went to the parliament, and she asked me &rsquo;why don&rsquo;t you stay there overnight?&rsquo; So here I come. (to be supplemented) But I am gonna end with this.&nbsp;</p><p>A Malaysian guy from internet asked me, why do you stay here? why did you listen to them and come? Are you doing the right thing? And I replied him, &rsquo;Making a correct or wrong decision is not my business or our business, but the business of this generation. Do we want to be just dummies, or the company of the hero? I want to be the latter, at least I feel happier after it all finishes. In the end, I like the animation &quot;Hyoka&quot;, and I even read the original novel. Hyoka said &rsquo;if you continue keeping silence, you are just like a zombie for all your life.&rsquo; (applause)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:47 [Jinan] (host) I understand that one must be very brave to express different opinions under this kind of situation. We all know that we are all sitting here for being against the service and trade agreement. When we are such a big crowd, there must be different voices, right? (right!) If we are all the same, we could have worn our uniform here. Actually we discussed previously at the back stage, if we should make selections for who goes onto the stage. But we think this is a stage of democracy and freedom for expressing yourselves, so people should be let free to go onto the stage. Actually we staff here are composed of volunteers from different NGO groups, such as Awakening Foundations for women... (to be supplemented). We&rsquo;ve stayed here from 12 to 6, from 6 to 12, and from 12 to 6. This is tiring. There are a lot of determination of policies which cannot be known by everyone effectively.&nbsp; Next one onto the stage is a 18 year student from Yen-Ping senior high school. Hey, is it really fine for a 18-year-old to stay outside so late? (laugh)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:41 [Jinan] Student Hou: I understood what a school carnival is when I arrived here. I saw that the passage for medical care was blocked, but somebody had something like seaweed soup in hand for sale. I sat down only later. And then the host asked us if we wanted to continue. It&rsquo;s like a class meeting in school. I feel it&rsquo;s strange. Aren&rsquo;t we here for a goal? For example, I climbed over the fence on the first day, and it&rsquo;s the first time in my life doing such kind of things. And I saw a policeman once I got off the fence. The police had red eyes and a red face, looking very angry. It&rsquo;s not their fault actually. They were just doing their work. But we also have our demand! Why should we let the policeman having their shift? We should organize, and plan how to push our front line. We cannot just sit here gently. We have something which we must achieve! (to be continued)</p><p></p><p>02:41 [Jinan] (host) Thank these guys! We are here today for protesting the service and trade agreement, and don&rsquo;t tell others that you&rsquo;ve come here for a live performance. (laugh) We have 2 students, welcome them. The first one is 19-year-old student Hou.</p><p></p><p>02:39 [Jinan] A professor: please applaud loud for them! (applause) It has been a exhausting day for them. They took the flight from Kaohsiung to here today, and they will fly back to France tomorrow. Thank you everyone.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:36 [Jinan] A professor: I&rsquo;ve been here for days. I will translate for them. There are 5 band members here, one is down the stage photographing. There will sing the song &quot;La Vie en Rose&quot;. Wish everyone can have their democratic and free life of rose.&nbsp; (performance)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:34 [Jinan] (host) I want to do a survey, because it is an event of democracy and freedom. There&rsquo;re still 6 groups of enthusiastic people wanting to come to the stage. Does any of you still want to continue after these people? OK, we organizers will tell you after the survey. Now &rsquo;LAVIONROSE&rsquo; from France will perform for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:28 [Jinan] Finn: I think there&rsquo;s one thing we all know. It&rsquo;s already Sunday, and the students might leave here on Monday. Sunday to Monday... can be a more stressful time. I hope I can still see you here at that time. For students from the mid and south Taiwan, I hope you can find your classmates for shower (梳洗?), you can get me too. Haha, next song!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:24 [Jinan] Finn performs &quot;Fukushima&quot;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:21 [Jinan] Finn: Hi, I am a musician and a song writer. I&rsquo;ve been staying here for hours. I&rsquo;ve seen people here sharing their opinions. I hope everyone can understand why we are here, by discussion to each other. As I see, you guys are almost falling asleep. Let me perform one more song: Fukushima.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:17 [QingDao E. Road] (host) The evening event tonight ends here. Please take a rest for the fight tomorrow. Thank you very much.</p><p></p><p>02:17 [Jinan] Music performance by folk song writer/musician Finn</p><p></p><p>02:15 [Jinan] (host) Do you know how hold was our previous speaker? Only 20! I am already 31, and I can hardly recall what I was doing when I was 20. Taiwan began to turn into democracy since I was about 15, so younger generation can grow up in a society with freedom and democracy. Today in such a big event, from Qingdao E. Rd. to here, everybody has their different opinion, like anti-CSSTA or whatever. We can do so just because we are in a democratic society.</p><p></p><p>02:04 [Jinan] (speech) I feel like I need to speak for the reporters for a moment. I feel like from the beginning they didn’t think they were doing that work [referring to earlier muckraking], but when it was sent back it got cut like that. I want to make a call out to the reporters out there for a moment: know that we are here because of the will of the people, we the people can see for ourselves, and we know what you are reporting on, it’s not just for the political parties to see, but for everyone isn’t it? I also want to call out to the KMT legislators out there; you all said that your political views were the people’s views, but now you are falling back into the party line. Do you think next election we won’t know? When we tell our children, we will have the proof. I also want to call out to everyone for a moment: you need to be vigilant against fear. There are times when our manpower is weak, next week is a busy time (mid-terms), but whens something happens I want to be here! I know everybody is busy, but I hope you can spread the word. I want to share with everyone a conversation with my mother. Me: Sorry, I know I should have told you, but I felt like I needed to be here, so I’m at the parliament. My mom: That’s ok, some things just need to be done. I support you.</p><p></p><p>01:46 [Jinan] (Jesus Sandoval, from Spain with fluent Mandarin) I’m a teacher and broadcast manager. The first week I came to&nbsp; Taiwan, the movement against Chen Shui-bian happened, and that helped me gradually understand Taiwan. I’ve been in Taiwan for 8 years, and seen a lot of cultural differences, and understood the situation of Taiwanese people more closely. I’m afraid, I hope there are no attacks. But the first day of the protests, I was proud of you. Watching news from other countries, they said the student protestors here in Taiwan were using some violence, but I haven’t seen any violence. I would like to teach everyone a little Spanish “Long Live Taiwan” (Viva Taiwan)!</p><p></p><p>01:40 [Jinan] (Lin Chen-fang, a young demonstrator) I worked for more than a year in Kunming, a second tier city in China. The people there are jealous that [people in] Taiwan have the ability to express their own opinions in public.</p><p></p><p>01:40 [Jinan] (YOYO, singer from Hong Kong) Today is my third day here, I just wanted to offer my support to everyone, because the last 3 or 4 years I’ve been in Taiwan receiving support. Hong Kong has changed a lot in the last decade, we look to you as an example.</p><p></p><p>01:37 [Qingdao E.] (Host) Now we will start the citizen’s forum (unclear); hang on a second, we are about to break the record, a 10 year old boy called Chen from New Taipei City would like to share with everyone (unclear)</p><p></p><p>01:35 [Jinan] (Host) I would like to share this report from a friend in China. “I’m from China, and today I want to support my friends and support Taiwan. In the last few years, I have made many Taiwanese friends in different people’s movements, and we should fight against any form of oppression. When oppression comes knocking, I will stand up with my friends. From the 18th I have been here, at that time there were only a few hundred people, we weren’t sure if the CSSTA would be changed. I support everyone, and I support protecting democracy!</p><p></p><p>01:34 [Jinan] (Host) Two cars from Pingtung’s Daren University of Science and Technology have just arrived, welcome!</p><p></p><p>01:33 [Jinan] (Li Yu-hsuan, NTU) Medicine is not a business, and shouldn’t be mentioned in an international trade agreement. If this passes, Chinese people will be coming en masse to make use of our medical resources, and that’s not right.</p><p></p><p>01:32 [Qingdao E.] (Gao, a student at Taipei U of Education) Are our leaders morons? The whole world has trust, and only the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t. I want to ask those professional servicemen and servicewomen, when you see the flag being flown upside-down, is it right to simply ask why should support the CSSTA? (Unclear) This morning Zhongtian [a TV news station] shot video of cigarette butts...</p><p></p><p>01:30 [Qingdao E.] (Chen, student) Our only desire is to make it clear that Taiwan is a democratic country. We don’t want backroom deals, the hundreds of thousands of people supporting us here hope that we can make this clear. Thank you!</p><p></p><p>01:23 (Jinan) [Host ] Political participation is not the matter of a single day or two days.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s something that must be integrated into daily life. If you don&rsquo;t want to pay attention to politics, they&rsquo;ll still pay attention to you. In your parents&rsquo; day, they had no way to occupy Jinan Rd., but we can, and we are Taiwan&rsquo;s future.&nbsp; What effect will the CSSTA have on the medical and public health regulations in Taiwan?&nbsp; I have a person with disabilities in my family, and the first time my sister had surgery, we had to sell our house.&nbsp; After that, however, there was national health insurance.&nbsp; I am really thankful for it.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>01:21 (Qingdao E. -gOv) (lost signal) Does everybody remember ECFA?&nbsp; (Note: trade agreement between Taiwan and China signed in July 2010) Taiwan has never been part of China, so how can we have this question of unification, there&rsquo;s just a question of takeover. Please, if there is anyone at Zhongtian [a TV news station] who consider themselves to be Taiwanese, please go find yourself a better job! Ever since the Hong Zhongqiu incident, I have felt that us Taiwanese people are different, we have started to change and we&rsquo;re not the same anymore. Also, you know that some people have said that Lin Fei-fan&rsquo;s call to surround the KMT headquarters was not good, but I don&rsquo;t feel that way, beucase you know that right now the KMT has the majority (lost signal)</p><p></p><p>01:15 (Qingdao E.) [Host] A Chinese teacher from Mackay Medical School wants to share a few words with its students here. The school president hopes that the students who are participating in the movement take care of their health and continue to press on.&nbsp; We want to deeply thank every student who was willing to sit here today.&nbsp; Could everyone give themselves a round of applause? Students in and outside of the legislative hall, it&rsquo;s late night now and cold.&nbsp; Please make sure that you all stay warm.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s anyone who starts feeling cold, please come tell us and we will help you take care of it.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>01:13 (Qingdao E. Rd.) [speech] ...(disconnected) So let&rsquo;s give an applause to the police (Note: people are trying to maintain peaceful interactions and regard the government as the only target). And also for ourselves!</p><p></p><p>01:10 (Jinan Rd) [Office worker Lee Pingyao]: I am a corporate accountant. These few days, after putting in overtime, I come over to take part. Jokingly, I can say I&rsquo;m coming here for the night shift and the overnight shift.&nbsp; Why do we occupy the legislature for the fourth and fifth days?&nbsp; Why are the members of Parliament still unmoved? There are so many publicly elected civil servants, yet they do not react. Political parties should be about assembling people, not assembling money, but these elected people are only about gathering money. These financial groups exploit our labor force, turning work into a system of job responsibilities, and taking our salaries and presenting them to election candidates. If you call your member of parliament, whether they&rsquo;re blue or green, they have no power to do what they need to do. It&rsquo;s left to us to come out ourselves. The power of the people out to make politicians worry.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re no longer begging them. If we were to call them now to come out, they&rsquo;d still be peacefully sleeping in their own beds.&nbsp; Right now you&rsquo;re playing dead and not responding, so in the next election you&rsquo;ll basically be dead candidates. Don&rsquo;t think that the oceans of people these two days means that we&rsquo;ve won either, because it&rsquo;s going to be after Sunday night... now the government is dragging things out, but we need to show that we can drag things out even longer. Everyone knows that the significance of being here is to protect our friends inside the Legislature, so that the police won&rsquo;t storm their barriers. But as soon as the government sees that there are fewer people, they will tell the police to evict the people inside. If the police begin to break down the barriers, then elections aren&rsquo;t where we participate in politics anymore. Tonight, this, here is where we participate in politics.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>01:08 (Qingdao E. Rd.) [Speaker] Are are friends from inside the conference hall ready? (Ready!) Then we&rsquo;ll give the microphone over to the conference hall.</p><p>  (Conference hall representative) We don&rsquo;t have any party affiliation. Today we sit together, but we also have our respective viewpoints. At the appropriate time, we will also, like eagles, take wing.   Now, we welcome a friend from Taichung.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>01:06 (Jinan Rd.) [announcer] I really want to stand here with everybody. It&rsquo;s really late now, but I still love to.</p><p></p><p>01:01 (Qingdao E. Rd.) [Anchor] Let&rsquo;s give a cry of &quot;Today Taiwan, Tomorrow Hong Kong&quot; to our friends in Hong Kong (shouts the slogan) We are a democratic country!</p><p></p><p>01:01&nbsp; (Jinan) (Zhang Yaoren of the band Red Hare) The third son is &quot;Oh, Beautiful Island!&quot;</p><p></p><p>00:59 (Jinan) (Zhang Yaoren of the band Red Hare) The second song is &quot;Don&rsquo;t trick me after I&rsquo;ve trusted you.&quot;</p><p></p><p>00:57 [Jinan Rd.] (Zhang Yaoren of the band Red Hare) I came on the first day, I came on the past few days too, and while many teachers came on stage to express their thoughts, I didn&rsquo;t need to say much.&nbsp; I saw a really cool scene.&nbsp; We were really cold at the side of the road. There were two guys on the side of the road reading a dense book about molecular structures.&nbsp; Taiwanese mobs really have the highest of standards!&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>00:57 [Qingdao E. Rd.] (Sally from Hong Kong) At Hong Kong, I ask friends for a donation of 10,000 NTD so I can fly here ... I think if we have a 24-hour labor strike and that of student, we can put pressure on the government.</p><p></p><p>00:53 [Jinan Rd.] (Zhang Yaoren of the band Red Hare) Graduate of Taipei arts school drama department, performing &quot;Why am I not someone who can change the world?&quot;</p><p></p><p>00:51 [Qingdao E.] ((Dr. Liu, NTU Hospital, Founder of 1985 citizen’s organization) Today everyone has really come together, so there’s no problems. Right now there are 50 medical staff inside the parliament fighting together with you, and 4 medical stations outside, in total 200 people. There are also lawyers and every type of professional here standing together until the final moment. My other persona is that of the founder of the 1985 organization, why don’t I say, because I hope everyone uses students to finish this movement. The sit-ins of the Wild Lily Movement lasted six days, and the previous era was ended, because the President at that time still had some brains. Now, this President hasn’t even responded after more than a hundred hours. We are already at ground zero, we don’t know what the next steps will be. The students inside are the most exhausted, do you have any idea what it’s like in there? 24 hours of bright lights makes it impossible to get any rest. Everyone thinks 1985 is fair and rational, while Island Nation Youth is extremist. But the most important part of a movement is having the demands met and letting others know about these problems. A movement that is either totally peaceful or totally violent will not be a successful one. The people disobey orders because the jurisprudence of this government has no legitimacy, so they are exercising their right to disobey and take this country back. Some people say they were held back by security, or that the attacks have been too extremist, but we absolutely cannot let ourselves be divided. If, internally, we are split into factions, it will be the start of our failure. Our movement was extreme at the beginning, and later became a peaceful act of civil disobedience. They still say we are here illegally occupying the parliament building. Does everyone remember which TV news station was flinging mud on these students? (Crowd: Zhongtian!) You said it, not me! The first day I snapped some photos of Zhongti</p><p>an reporters playing with their phones and smoking cigarettes, but I have higher standards than that. During the Ukraine protests, did the reporters photograph them eating snacks and smoking cigarettes? There are many kind-hearted reporters doing their duty. The beat of the movement has definitely changed, and when it needs to take action it does. We need to come together, and support the students. We have already come to a road which has never before been walked down, don’t listen to those old hacks, They are at the wrong meeting, don’t listen to those rumors!</p><p></p><p>00:49 [Jinan Rd.] At any time there will be at least 4 to 6 lawyers inside (the hall). Also if any confrontation (with the police) happens, you can remain silent and call 02)2523-1178 (Judical Reform Foundation)</p><p></p><p>00:46 [Jinan Rd.] (Lawyer Mr. Wu) We have 270 volunteer lawyer (and increasing). I want to clarify something, personally. I entered the hall on Friday at 4 pm, and came out at 10:30 pm. There was no air conditioner for a while, but later it became fine. The problem about having no toilet is also resolved, and many food were brought inside. We also have a medical team of about 30 there.a medical team of about 30 there.</p><p></p><p>00:46 [Jinan Rd.] Lawyer Mr. Wu comes to the stage.</p><p></p><p>00:46 [Jinan Rd.] (Host) If anyone wants to share his/ her opinion, just come to front.</p><p></p><p>00:45 [Jinan Rd.] (Prof. Hong) We know we are doing the right thing, so must persist.</p><p></p><p>00:40 [Jinan] Even as mayor, Ma Ying-jeou wasn’t good, and he still became President; that is unfortunate for us. Everything I said is rooted in science, it’s not made up, so Ma Ying-jeou has no basis to sue me for slander, but he could sue me for breaking the confidentiality of national secrets. Anyway, I believe that Xi Jin Ping knew about these national secrets early on, so they could plan the CSSTA, only allowing it to pass with no modifications. We can only understand last year’s dispute between Ma and Wang if we analyze Ma’s thought process in this way. Even though Ma is not winning, he must keep on trying until the end, because he has frontal lobe damage. That’s why after Fukushima, he kept trying to continue construction of Nuclear Plant No. 4.</p><p></p><p>00:43 [Conference Hall] (Organizer) Attention all group leaders: please clear all of the rubbish from your desks and chairs, some people will soon be coming through to help sort out the chairs. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>00:41 [Jinan] (Professor Hong) President Ma doesn’t care about others, he only cares about himself, his vision, and his authority. He doesn’t listen to anyone else’s opinions, and people like this are unable to cope with the changing circumstances in this country. People like this are unqualified to be President. The citizenry’s eyes shine brightly, and we can see Ma’s capabilities quite clearly.</p><p></p><p>00:37 [Qingdao E.] (Hot-blooded Taipei Mother) I had to wait until my husband and children were asleep before I could come out. I voted for Ma Ying-jeou, but I was wrong. Why hasn’t the legislature been helping us? Go to hell! If you could think about others a bit more, would Taiwan be in this position? It’s two countries not “two coasts” [referring to “One China Policy”].</p><p></p><p>00:35 [Jinan] (Professor Hong) President Ma has made all types of questionable remarks, and other members of the government always simply brush it off. When this happens with children, it’s cute, but it’s unacceptable when coming from the head of state. It seems possible that Ma’s frontal lobes are damaged.</p><p></p><p>00:34 (Conference Hall) [Host] Anyone who’s not ready to sleep yet please come to the front, let the people at the back have a rest. Please be considerate. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>00:30 (Conference hall) [Host]&nbsp; It&rsquo;s already 12:30. Would everyone please get your sleeping bags and cardboard and prepare to rest? This is a long battle, please everyone be sure to rest well.</p><p></p><p>00:28 (Jinan) [Professor Hong] This protest is great therapy for Taiwan. The hour is late, but we need to still press on.&nbsp; Our President Ma has said many things that lack wisdom, which simply allow us to laugh. (details many laughable things that President Ma said in the past)  </p><p></p><p>00:26 (Jinan Rd.) [Anchor] Now we invite Professor Hong from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology to share with us.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>00:14 (Linsen S.) We are still lacking people.

Rd.) [Member of public] &nbsp; My mom again and again told me I couldn&rsquo;t come, but I came because Taiwanese citizens need to stand up.&nbsp; Even though we are a small country, we can&rsquo;t let China unceasingly coerce us. Many people ask why South Korea signed, because they are an independent country. Ma Ying-jeou, are you going to come out and speak to us or not?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>00:05&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>00:03 (Qingdao E.) [Ms. Kao, Pingtung] Last night I sat on the train for 6 hours to get here. My job is taking care of elderly people. Those grandmothers and grandfathers know that China is not a just country.

But we now shine with creativity and thought, so that the world can see us. Once the CSSTA was signed, we showed the world that when our methods are being cut, we need to stand together to protect democracy; to protect this little island. We are not only a economic miracle, but also a symbol for democracy. The world is watching us.</p><p></p><p>23:57 (Qingdao E.) [Taichung student named Li] Thank you everybody for pouring your soul into our democracy. Is coercing our country into signing the agreement fair and reasonable? Premier Jiang gave us an answer that we cannot accept. We must keep on fighting. My parents called me, but I always hang up. I told them I had to stay here because I have to protect Taiwan&rsquo;s democracy. (Calls his mom) Taiwan (Go!), Taiwan (Go!). Thank you mom, thank you everybody.</p><p></p><p>23:52 (Jinan) [Speaker] The Chinese Communist Party suppresses the flow of information, and forces books to censor their contents. Do we dare to challenge China? In the future, after signing the trade pact, will we have the ability to communicate and negotiate with China? Our publishing industry will definitely be seriously influenced. Our culture cannot be destroyed. We must protect our independence.  </p><p></p><p>23:47 (Conference Hall) [Host] It has become late again.

[Speaker] We are displaying a very high standard of culture. In my twenty years of observing social movements, Taiwan has improved a lot (signal lost), we need room in which to maneuver, to give our future a chance.

(Unclear)&nbsp; For us, when construction on Nuclear Plant No. 4 stopped, our protest would be finished. We wanted proof of the willpower of water, but what were we most afraid of? The softness of water; we wanted to use the softness of students. Today, you are all here (signal lost) we weren’t interested in politics, but this country is ours, when Plant No. 4 explodes we won’t care about [political] factions, because there will be nothing left. Everyone sees your softness and warmth; but we will also need strength to continue. We can be warm and soft towards other people, but when others treat our demands unjustly, we need strength to continue!

There seems to be less lectures of political science and history these days so I thought to reinforce a bit. Without the knowledge in the field of politics and history, there are no chances of winning this protest. The citizen movement is a political movement. To publish and to comment on the issues freedom. I was a victim of the audit of China publish. Although I am not a victim as a Taiwanese merchant, I fell a victim. I translated &quot;Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism&quot;. It is one of the most brilliant books of humanities. It focuses on the research of nationalism and has rewritten the history of mankind. I have to let you know about the victim experience of this book. Shanghai People&rsquo;s Publishing House of China published the Simplified Chinese version that rudely modified and deleted the contents of this book. Chapter 9 was left in bit and pieces because there were trifles about Deng Xiaoping and Zhou Enlai. The review that I have written in the very end, a paragraph of sensibility for Taiwan, was completed removed from the book. Having my homeland Taiwan totally removed from the book is a very serious insult to the researchers. In the newer edition published 2 years ago, Dr. Anderson has mentioned about how the Taiwan edition has become a China edition. The Taiwan editors have requested Shanghai to not remove this part of it, but they deleted the paragraphs regardless. I have to say, they sure are worthy to deserve the name of the Rising China.</p><p></p><p>22:23(Conference Hall) [Anchor] <b>The strike action is aided by Pharmacist Association.</b></p><p></p><p>22:23(Conference Hall) [Anchor] The CNA News just announced that President Ma. is going to hold a press conference tomorrow morning.</p><p></p><p>22:20(Conference Hall) [Anchor] The further movement of next week will be arousing protestants from other associations to perform strike action.

Last Tuesday I was attracted to here because of the activity, and I also stormed the parliament, and I stayed there for quite a few days. Regarding the CSSTA, all of us have our own demands, and there&rsquo;re a lot of differences to sort out. Will deliberation of every single article of the treaty makes this treaty just and right? OK even though we made the government retreats the trade pact, we successfully occupied the parliament, we forced President Ma to give his reply, but it&rsquo;s same old rubbish he talked, are we still going to occupy forever? Can we maintain the size of the crowd? What if President Ma persists on? Should we pack things up and go home? I can&rsquo;t give any answers to these questions - but this is the upside of liberty. We don&rsquo;t need to wait for the lawmakers to react if this matter is urgent enough. Going from dictatorship to liberty means destroying the inequalities between the government and the people, and demands everyone to develop independent thinking; however the reverse is a much easier process - Stop thinking and we are going backwards. People, please think about what you are demanding, And how far will you go to achieve your ideal.</p><p></p><p>21:22 (QingDao E. Rd.) [A message from a Liberal Studies teacher from <b>Hong Kong</b>] I&rsquo;d like to give my support to all of you, and I discussed the CSSTA with my students.

However, the situation today still disappoint us.&nbsp; Premier Jiang was clear on his position regarding the two appeal we have. He will not return CSSTA. Secondly,&nbsp; Premier Jiang&nbsp; believes that The four legal technicalities would handle the situation. However, Law ranks higher than Legal technicalities. Without passing the law, we have no right to supervise the making of related acts. We are disappointed. We can’t see the future of our country. Lastly,&nbsp; Premier Jiang mentioned that the Pact is in relation with President Ma. And this is our only consensus. We think that he frustrated, he have no real power to make any decision. Thus, Ma Ying-Jiu come out and face this. Rigorous examination of CSSTA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>17:36 (Conference Hall) Premier Jiang has told us his opinion. He answered our first demand with:&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The Executive Yuan is not planning to revoke the CSSTA, because it brings great advantages for the Taiwanese people.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>We do not agree with this point of view. First, the CSSTA indeed does carry advantages for Taiwanese. But only for the few large corporations that are planning to expand to China. For the average service industry and employee it is very harmful. We do not condone judgind the situation only from the large corporations point of view. Furthermore, even if the CSSTA had only advantages, the decision process was not in accordance with democratic procedures.</p><p></p><p>17:31 (Conference Hall) Lawyer Lai please explain Cross-strait Supervision Regulation.

Unfortunately, Premier Jiang did not make any promise.</p><p></p><p>17:36 (Qingdao E.) The ones who hold power still get away from responsibilities, and we are still protesting.

[Ms. Zhang from Taipei] I&rsquo;m dizzy because I haven&rsquo;t slept for 4 days. I&rsquo;m just a girl who likes to dance, and not some social elite. I think we all have a mission. I think if we understand history better we would not be where we are today. 60 years ago the 228 incident happened because we demanded our rights. Today I think that President Ma has violated the law and the constitution, I think we should put out a bulletin for his arrest. I don&rsquo;t understand why the police is listening to him and not arresting him. I am here today because I don&rsquo;t want our future to be in their hands. I live in areas where Chinese people often visit. I don&rsquo;t mind them, they are just people, but I don&rsquo;t care for the Chinese government because they have no concept of human rights. Liu Xiaobo is still in prison and Xinjiang is still being suppressed. My body is shaking, perhaps from a lack of sleep, but I am not worried because there&rsquo;s a medical team here. If our country doesn&rsquo;t change we&rsquo;ll need to come out every day. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot the past few days, while my education taught me only to love dancing and not care about my society.</p><p></p><p>14:37 (Qingdao E.) [Student surnamed Chen from Taipei] This is my first time at an event like this. Has anyone seen &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;? Are we not, like the movie, letting the officials get away with it? Haven&rsquo;t we been too uncaring in the past? My friends are still playing online games, and they said playing games have nothing to do with the CSSTA. An article online said that President Ma is very smart, and has planned everything. Well, I say that even if we are doomed to fail we should still come out and at least try. Perhaps if someone else was president we would still end up here because we have been too uncaring, but no more.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>14:27 (Qingdao E.) [Nat&rsquo;l Central Uni. student, chem materials dept.] This is my first time here. I&rsquo;ve never come out before, not for Corporal Hung&rsquo;s case, not for the Dapu case. I always thought someone else will come out for me. But I think the CSSTA is an issue that is very connected with our daily lives. Officials and professors are highly situated in society and are less affected by the CSSTA, but us salary earners are strongly affected. I&rsquo;ve only been here one full day and one night, probably less than many others, I appreciate your coming. Supplies have been handed out continuously, but people are considerate and worried that others will not have enough. We can all stay home and speak empty words of support, but we decided to come out. We are under a lot of pressure, we&rsquo;ve been besmirched, but we are at a historical turning point. I never cared about it before, and always thought that society would take care of it, but it is people like you that is makingus pay attention, do research, watch videos, and understand what it is all about. Even if people are against different things - CSSTA itself, the lack of transparency, even communism - we listen to everyone sincerely and without judgement. We are mature citizens. We know at least that this version of the CSSTA is unacceptable. We are against the lack of transparency and the lack of proper procedure. Finally, I want to thank the students here, the police, and volunteers. If you are a volunteer and you are tired, please let us know, we will rise up and support you.</p><p></p><p>14:21 (Jinan Rd.)

[Hong Kong Citizen] Financial, communication and advertising industries mustn&rsquo;t open to the Chinese. The financial industry&rsquo;s boss is the Chinese Communist Party, and they invade other industries by purchasing. The financial structure is very weak, and yet the CCP is a bunch of trickster. They claim to be communists, but in fact they are a bunch of horrible capitalists. Communication industries mustn&rsquo;t open to Chinese because they can access and monitor our communications after they have input their capital. If advertising industries have fallen into the hand of the Chinese, would Taiwan still be able maintain her right of free speech? We need to tell everybody why we are against the CSSTA in a peaceful manner.</p><p></p><p>14:15: (Qingdao E. Rd.)

(Prof. Cheng from Hong Kong Poly U Applied Sociology Department) There is a saying in Hong Kong, that it needs mainland China to maintain its GDP growth. However, the gap between the rich and the poor is widening, and over one million people are living in poverty. Hong Kong&rsquo;s wealth disparity is the most serious among all other countries, but we didn&rsquo;t riot. As students, teachers and teens in Taiwan protest against the CSSTA, some people there claim that the action is anti-globalization. They believe that if Taiwan does not sign this treaty with mainland China it will be marginalized, and the unemployment rate will soar. However, I believe to be against the CSSTA is to be for democratic action and equal rights, because globalization is an economic condition of Neoliberalism. 1. Most industries in mainland China are monopolized by major corporations, but there is an appearance of parity between China and Taiwan. For example there is a major dentist chain in China which dominates a part of China&rsquo;s dental service. Dental service in Taiwan however is usually run by individuals. The market in mainland China is a near monopoly, RMB is not freely exchangeable all over the world, meaning it&rsquo;s a monopolized commodity. Mainland China has been depriving the working class of benefits and exporting their commodities by taking advantage of its low costs, all while claiming that they prefer and love freedom. This is their &quot;party-state capitalism&quot;, or raw capitalism. This is not the American-style capitalism we are used to, this is all-consuming. Chinese capital is all-consuming, whether you be large or small. If this sort of capitalism enters the local economy, everything inside the local economy will be consumed. For example, food stands in HK have all but disappeared, and replaced by jewelry stores, because they no longer need to provide a local service to be profitable, they can provide services to foreigners.&nbsp;</p><p>Also because of the large number of new immigrants from mainland China has diluted the democratic electorate base, now less than 1/3 of HK&rsquo;s population prefers democracy. 1. They no longer have the right to choose the head of the HKSAR, and their legislators are not all popularly elected, but some are selected from industry representatives. The CSSTA is not neoliberalism, it&rsquo;s a crony of the communist party. HK people who support us believe we are fighting against communists, against the party-state capitalism they represent.</p><p></p><p>13:14 (Conference Hall) [announcer] The &quot;no voice recording&quot; order applies only when doctors are interviewing patients.</p><p></p><p>13:13 (Qingdao) [announcer]&nbsp;</p><p>We urge people to be selective in choosing their sources of information, and don&rsquo;t get controlled by political parties or rumors.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>13:13 (Conference Hall) [announcer] Announcements: The medical team will do quick checkups for everyone, including our friends in the press. you may film but please absolutely no voice recording.

The attorneys group now consists of 300 strong, which all of us promise to help the students with their lawsuits. The current Parade and Assembly Law requires the protest organizers to apply in advance, but the road is ours. Taiwan Legislative Yuan&rsquo;s darkness is caused by the lawmakers.

We need more people to examine CSSTA together.</p><p></p><p>12:31 (Conference Hall) [Anchor] Last night a volunteer was injured, was sent to the hospital and is currently alright, thanks for all the concern.&nbsp; And (note: probably is talking about the situation inside the Parliament) there has been no decrease in the number of the people here, most people are just resting.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>12:30 (Conference Hall) [Anchor] There is news that Premier Jiang Yi-huah is on his way to communicate with the students outside of the Parliament. News source: NextTV.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>12:28 (Conference Hall) Students from Chung-Cheng Univ is making newspaper for us (no English version available yet, but see other resources at top!) There has been no attack from the police so far. We&rsquo;re still deciding what to do next. Please check the FB page (<a href='https://www.facebook.com/lslandnationyouth'/>黑色島國青年陣線</a>) (in Chinese) to see what resources are needed at the moment.</p><p></p><p>12:12 (Conference Hall) [Commander] Many friends shown interests in the announcement we made yesterday which that we stated that we would surround the KMT headquarters around the country.&nbsp; The main purpose of our goal is to let people around the country join us.&nbsp; We know that yesterday there were already a lot of peaceful protesters in the Kaohsiung Hsing-in and Chiayi branch.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>12:09 (Qingdao E. Rd.) [Mr. Yang from Hsinchu speaking] I am an engineer in Hsinchu. This is my first time to participate in such an movement. As for we need the agreement with China, well, in my area, there are many companies who will paid 3 times or 4 times more salary to hire skilled engineers (from Taiwan). After the agreement I think they only need to pay 2 times more... I have worked for 6 years but I cannot own my house, as it&rsquo;s just too expensive. If we sign the agreement, more people from the Mainland will come to push the price of the estates higher.</p><p></p><p>12:07 (Conference Hall) [Anchor] At 12 pm we were about to made an announcement, but because of office of the president ... (signal lost). Later there will be some time when people can come into the Parliament hall, but we&rsquo;re not sure yet when will it be.</p><p></p><p>12:05 (Conference Hall) [Anchor] The team is in the process of changing shifts. And everyone please refrain from replying to the meaningless comments, it will only make communications more difficult because we do not have direct communications with outside.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>11:55 (Qingdao E. Rd.) [Mr. Kao, Taiwanese Aborigine] Under the rule of ROC (Republic of China), we don&rsquo;t live like a human. My grandpa&rsquo;s land was stolen, my father had to be a miner, and I have to work in a factory after I finish my elementary school education. How did we gain our democracy? Our government raid our properties. You stand for yourself, and so do us aborigines, because we are the right owner of our land.</p><p></p><p>11:43 (Jinan Rd.) [NTU Math professor] Your passion gave us hope, colleagues and I drafted a statement, all 25 of us.&nbsp; We do not disagree with the signing of CSSTA, however the process must be transparent.&nbsp;&nbsp; The students are the generation most affected by the policy, therefore they have the right to know. First, we suspect the government&rsquo;s solution for the persistent low-wage problem is to send Taiwan&rsquo;s talented workers to Mainland.&nbsp; Second, we worry about the recent&nbsp; safety of our national human resource websites.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>11:25 (Jinan Rd.) [Historian] I am specialized in looking into the past and forecast the future, us historians are the lookout of the society. We weren&rsquo;t selected to help President Ma for the negotiation of CSSTA, because we have a ruler in our head. You will discover that the shops in the 1st Line City of mainland China is no match of Taiwan&rsquo;s, this is because the amount of consumer shop license is actually very limited. We call this capitals in the cloud. The riches now own giant co-operations which are richer than the church. There&rsquo;re a lot of variations in the CSSTA, meaning the internal manpower exchange within the co-operations is impossible to spot inside the CSSTA.</p><p></p><p>11:10 (Jinan Rd.) [Member of the public] Noam Chomsky has written the Pirate and Emperors. We are called pirates because we only have a small boat; You are called an emperor because you have a navy. But we are not a small ship, but a big navy!</p><p></p><p>10:56 (Jinan Rd.) [Member of the public] After knowing the result of the Hung Chung-Chiu case, I decided that I mustn&rsquo;t let my country fall and I came back from the USA. After that Taiwan has a lot going on. I didn&rsquo;t come back to go to mainland and earn 52k dollars a month! There&rsquo;s hardly enough support to the social care system, introducing Chinese into the system can only brings more problem and harm.</p><p></p><p>10:46 (Jinan Rd.) [Member of the public] Six hundred thousand mainlanders with 100 billion dollars on their hands can come here. They have the right to elect or to be elected. It would only takes the mainland government 6 trillion to buy the entire Taiwan. Hopefully the government can listen to the public rationally.</p><p></p><p>10:24 (Jinan Rd.) [college professor] This is a story about a country that magically disappears. The people of a country was fortunate and diligent, and created an economic miracle. Once the country became prosperous it managed to transform itself from a totalitarian state to a democratic state. This country also has a lot of love for its neighbors. But one day this country decided to let its elected leaders give itself over to the totalitarian state nearby and destroy itself. What kind of a country is this? This is the moment our country is about to magically disappear.</p><p></p><p>10:20 (Jinan Rd.) [Member of the public] They say the wage over the other side of the strait is better, but let&rsquo;s think about this - Who is lowering the wage on this side of the strait? If we encourage local spending, we can then achieve our ideal, develop our culture and this is what I call a country. The people over there are fighting for a capitalist economy, which money can&rsquo;t reach the pockets of the majority of population. This sort of free economy is just wrong. The opening of social grade is not that scary.You are a man, not a robot. You achieve your goals by working, not working aimlessly like a machine. Creating our own culture in the free, safe and abundant society makes us the Formosa.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>10:11 (Jinan Rd.) [Teacher, Mr.Chang] I defended the &rsquo;One syllabus, Many Textbook&rsquo; policy six years ago, and as a result I was sacked by the school. Your point of view will be suppressed if you choose to be quiet, and what was done to me by the school is basically a warning to others. In the last six years I had believed that being a teacher was a shame, because I was suppressed from teaching the right thing to my students but now, there&rsquo;re so many people protesting here. Our generation occupies all resources, and we are always pessimistic about, or even afraid of the future. This is my generation&rsquo;s fault. The government says we are violent, but I see otherwise - students packing up and recycle the waste they produced. Why the government has to push around the students? You lot has achieved what we dare not do. We are too used to comfortable, but we never think about the future of our children. I can see critical thinking and future from you lot. End the old ideology! Please carry on!&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>09:59 (Qingdao) [announcer] Emergency announcement, we need a blow-dryer, please send one over if you have one.</p><p></p><p>09:58 (Jinan Rd.) [Member of the Public] We will have no way back if you don&rsquo;t stand out today. Hong Kong has fallen into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party in 1997. It&rsquo;s very brave of you to wake up Taiwan by protesting. I told the Koreans on the Metro that they could go to the Parliament to see what liberty actually means, and asked them to speak for Taiwan in anywhere else.</p><p></p><p>09:58 (Conference Hall) [Attorney Lin] Many of our friends are spreading the new on the Internet to an international level. It&rsquo;s simply because our president and legislators refused to tell us what the impact is after the pact is signed and they don&rsquo;t even bother to follow legal procedures.</p><p></p><p>09:43(Jinan) [Intern doctor, Liao] The number of doctors have not increased these years and medical care has become merchandised. The government does not have a solid social health care system but then open the market to the Mainland. which turns this into a field for capitalists. People who actually work in this field are going to be exploited. We should think from the standpoint of laborors.</p><p>[repeated]</p><p></p><p>09:50 (Conference Hall) Attorney Lin: We appreciate your efforts. You&rsquo;ve been here for 121 hours, and you&rsquo;re creating history. Thank you all very much... I see a lot of students, and a lot of my seniors in the legal community, so I had to come... Us the attorney team was talking earlier, to decide whether we will form a roster and hold evening shifts. Many of us have families, and we will come out if our families are alright. We have elected a leader, his country is his home, but he&rsquo;s not communicating with his home. We are here today to let him know that he needs to talk to his home...</p><p></p><p>09:44 (Conference Hall) [Anchor] We are still resting here, and outside they are still speaking and doing their sit-in. People can go online to search for &quot;If the media won&rsquo;t report it, we will!&quot; (媒體不報，我們來報) This is done by a group of college students who came here and wrote some reports on the events here. You can search for their reports online to understand the situation. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>09:43 (Jinan Rd.) [Interning Dr. Liao]: We haven&rsquo;t had more doctors over the past years, and medicine is increasingly becoming commercialized. The government isn&rsquo;t doing well in the social welfare aspect and they&rsquo;re opening it up to China for them to seek profit. This will worsen the crushing conditions health workers are already suffering under, and they should think about this from the workers&rsquo; perspective.</p><p></p><p>09:28 (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Zhan from Tamkang University: The country and the government have failed to build a stage for us. Instead, the government just tell us to work outside Taiwan. We pay so much money to the government and still we need make-up classes. Is this the failure of Education Departure? Is this the failure of representative democracy? We can use the internet to develop a better system to monitor the country, and exercise liberty.</p><p></p><p>09:27 (Qingdao E. Rd.) [announcer] I need to tell everyone something. There were too many people signing up to speak last night, and the information got a bit chaotic, so we need you to sign up again, thanks! Also, at 10am there will be a lesson on democracy so sign-up speaking will not take place at that time.</p><p></p><p>09:17 (Jinan Rd.) Director Chen: I filmed a documentary called &quot;Red Curfew&quot; (紅色戒嚴)The documentary describes how President Ma&rsquo;s government used their power to call more than 7000 police to fight against Taiwanese citizens. This was the turning point for Taiwan&rsquo;s democracy, and from that point onwards our democracy has been on the decline. At that time, the media&nbsp; kept showing footage of police being hurt by the protesters, don&rsquo;t you think this is similar to what we are witnessing now? Are we a mob? You broke the window glass to let in light and air, to bring a ray of hope to our democracy. But the government keeps claiming that the students area mob , that they are destroying Taiwan&rsquo;s democracy. If this isnt tyranny what is? You have already left poems in Taiwan&rsquo;s 100 year long history of chasing democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>09:16 (Qingdao) Ms. Wang from Taipei U: Hello all... many have been asking us &quot;you&rsquo;re against the CSSTA, do you even know what it is?&quot; But I don&rsquo;t understand why the people needs to go out and try to understand what it is, why isn&rsquo;t the government telling us about what it is trying to do. And then I read about that legislator and how he put the CSSTA on record, I feel this is really too much, and we need to stand up for ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>09:10 (Qingdao) Student surnamed Wu, of NTU Business school: Hello all, it seems like there are a lot of people here, but our movement may not be very successful. Even if we have 100k people here, that&rsquo;s less than1 % of Taiwan&rsquo;s population. We use social media to link up, but a lot of people don&rsquo;t use social media, and rely on traditional media instead. Furthermore, traditional media is seriously biased, and the government is controlling their information. We need to let people be aware of the importance of independent media. I hear a lot of people say that they don&rsquo;t want to talk politics, but politics is everybody&rsquo;s business, so you cannot avoid politics. I want to say that even if we fail, we should not be discouraged. because we are progressing every time. Since the Corporal Hung incident, we&rsquo;ve been progressing. So please don&rsquo;t lose hope and don&rsquo;t think we can&rsquo;t change things.</p><p></p><p>09:06 (Jinan Rd.) Protester: I am a social worker, and oftentimes a questions has no ready solution and we need to work on it together. Your youth is your hope, many young people are still fighting inside, I am touched by your proactiveness, and we should not discount anyone, because everyone has unlimited potential. I need to learn from the young people here. Thank you all for letting us see a new hope for Taiwan.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>09:04 (Jinan Rd.) Material Service: We need 6-7 volunteers here to help out.</p><p></p><p>08:53 (Jinan Rd.) Member of the public: No one wants to work when they are ill - this is the responsibility of Labour&rsquo;s Health and Safety. The contribution to Taiwan of the working class should be recognized.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>08:39 (Jinan Rd.) Protester: Workers having to work overtime without pay is against labor laws, and the government should step in.</p><p></p><p>08:21 Update: The Chinese Live Relay has been out of sync for more than 30 minutes. The records will be translated as soon as they&rsquo;re available. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>08:18 (Qingdao) [announcer] Okay, we&rsquo;ve been looking for the UDN and China Times newspapers, please wait a moment... oh here they are. Let&rsquo;s look at UDN: (Parliament Speaker) Wang&rsquo;s announcement conveyed three points, that the CSSTA review is not an intra-ministry issue, but an issue between the two parties in the legislature, and he hopes that the president will listen to the people. Headline: Wang refuses Ma in three points, inter-ministry meeting failed. Now China Times: &quot;Wang refused to attend, meeting failed.&quot; &quot;Activism expands with 3 demands, will surround KMT offices&quot; &quot;Battle Line expands, KMT offices surrounded, Ma: retreat then we&rsquo;ll talk.&quot; Oh is that what he&rsquo;s saying? He&rsquo;ll talk only after we retreat? We hope he can respond to our demands.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>08:17 (Jinan) Ms. Chu: In 1979 there was a PCB pollution issue, but it was overshadowed by the Meilidao Incident. Many cases of skin disease resulted, and the rice and cooking oil of that time were often contaminated by PCB. The government should be responsible and the CSSTA should have safeguards to protect workers&rsquo; rights, please let your family members know about this issue.</p><p></p><p>08:16 (QingDao E. Rd.) Host: We have a lost iCash card and a lost Credit Card. Please retrieve your lost properties here.</p><p></p><p>08:00 (QingDao E. Rd.) Ms. Wang from TaiNan: Good morning everyone, I am a home designer... I am moved by the defiance action taken by all Taiwanese to protect ourselves. And even under this situation, the volunteers are still trying to keep things clean and tidy. I just want to give my heartfelt thank you to them. I have a exchange student friend from Hong Kong. After she arrived, she just don&rsquo;t want to go back to Hong Kong and she married to a Taiwanese after her graduation. However Taiwan just doesn&rsquo;t seem that good now. Another Hong Kongese friend of mine said she used to be proud of being a Hongkonger, just like us being proud of being a Taiwanese, before everything there turns mainland-ish... I would like to thank all of the brave teens who stormed the Legislative Yuan, who managed to wake the public up. Thank you very much!</p><p></p><p>07:17 (Jinan Rd.) [host] Please bring your idea up and discuss.</p><p></p><p>07:00 (Jinan Rd.) OB-Gyn Dr.Lin: Allowing the employers to give pay cuts under this shortage of manpower in medical industry, what is on the employers&rsquo; mind is &rsquo;Passing the CSSTA would means more cheap labour&rsquo;. It is certain this will have serious negative impacts to the medical industry, because price competition would lower the already low enough 22k dollar / month wage rate of the doctors. There is already a shortage of input into the medical system, allowing more mainlanders into Taiwan to enjoy health care would further worsen the situation.</p><p></p><p>06:54 (Jinan Rd.) OB-Gyn Dr.Lin: Ignoring pension issues and tax problems while shouting &rsquo;We will save our own country&rsquo; is being hypocritical.</p><p></p><p>06:46 (Jinan Rd.) OB-Gyn Dr. Lin: It&rsquo;s great to be here, but it is also our responsibility to be here, we&rsquo;ve been numbed by our small successes and we need to undo what we&rsquo;ve let happen. I hope this is a beginning and not an end.</p><p></p><p>06:40 (Jinan Rd.) [Host] We may choose not to believe in CSSTA. We have to commence new actions.</p><p></p><p><b>06:31 (Jinan Rd.) [Host] Everybody has a different vision for Taiwan. I am against free trade. Some incidents have not been exposed in Taiwan, like in 2008 when Canada, the USA and Mexico met for free trade agreement talks. The North American Free Trade Agreement has not brought about the desired impacts, showing us that free trade&rsquo;s promises are false promises.</b></p><p></p><p>06:18 (Jinan Rd.) [Ms. Lai] The people inside (the conference hall) are sacrificing their freedom in exchange for Taiwan&rsquo;s freedom and democracy. I am very thankful for that.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:09 (Jinan Rd.)

(silence) We&rsquo;re going to retake China, right? (silence)</p><p></p><p>05:44 (QingDao E. Rd.) [Mr. Lin from TaiNan] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, I am now studying in Fu Jen Catholic University (輔仁大學) in Taipei. Starting from the first day of our &rsquo;Anti-CSSTA&rsquo;, &rsquo;Anti-Black-boxing&rsquo;, till today when the government declares that black-box operation is not against the law - however I don&rsquo;t think these are the important points. We are standing out here today to tell the government - You should at put improving education platforms at a higher priority, instead of negotiating for the treaty. We are here to tell the government - we teens have the power do anything. Thank you.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>05:42 (Qingdao - g0v) [Mr. Wang giving a speech] I am 27, and I have been working since 16. I&rsquo;ve been to Australia. When people there asked if I am Chinese, I said I am Taiwanese! Go Taiwan! Peace!</p><p></p><p>05:40 (Qingdao E. Rd.) [host] Let&rsquo;s see. The sun has arisen. Let&rsquo;s have an applause for ourselves for holding on so far! (applause) If you want to go home to have a rest, a breakfast or a shower you should go. And keep in touch! You can check what&rsquo;s happening all the time on the internet. Things can happen at any time.</p><p></p><p>05:36 (Jinan Rd) Student surnamed Lin from National University of the Arts: We need a 3rd major political party!</p><p></p><p>05:34 (QingDao E. Rd.) [Mr. Chang from TaiChung] I am at about 60. I come here, because I see the young generation have their dreams, and I think a men as old as me should support you. What&rsquo;s happening right now is beyond our imagination: the economy of the society is in danger. And Ma Ying-jeou did whatever he wants, regardless of the Constitution. Maybe the history of Taiwan will end soon. Now at least we have brave young people who stand out, like those who did in Wild Lily Student Movement (24 years ago, students in Taiwan protest for democracy. It&rsquo;s generally marked as an important turning point for democratic Taiwan). I am very happy that the young generation have stood out for democracy.</p><p></p><p>05:34 (Jinan Rd.) [Student Wu, from DongWu Univ.] No matter what you ask for, we all want to wake up the government. What they are doing now is absolutely wrong. And the media keep misleading our parents</p><p></p><p>05:33 (QinDao E. Rd.)&nbsp; [Host]&nbsp; Thanks. The following is 100th people!! Mr. Chang from TaiChung.</p><p></p><p>05:31 (Jinan Rd.)&nbsp; [Citizen] Now that there are so many social media sites, you are your own media, your own Anchor.</p><p></p><p><b>05:26 (KMT office Taipei) Police occupied the Taipei KMT office a few hours ago.

To avoid certain media to catch a few of your words and&nbsp; produce a negative news out of it, when you meet a media reporter, you&nbsp; can refer them to the speaker of the movement.</p><p></p><p>05:22 (QingDao E. Rd. - g0v)&nbsp; Mr (?) from Longtan: I am a &quot;hooligan&quot;, a citizen embracing freedom. I apologize for their Chinese. We are here for our freedom. We must remember why we came out here in the first place!! I also think the government is too conservative, and they are still using traditional methods, forgetting that we now know how to use the internet to find information for ourselves. We shouldn&rsquo;t blame these people of the last generation, because they are products of their time. But we are not! We will not be deceived by mainstream media. I came here after work, because I believe our students need support from our working class. I ask that people not use the old definitions of &quot;pan-Blue&quot; and &quot;pan-Green&quot; in the next election, we must not be lied to again. Lie to me once, shame on you; lie to me twice, shame on me. Lie to me 3 times and we deserve to be called idiots. We are not idiots! The vision of the old has become blurry and colored, we must learn to look for ourselves and speak for ourselves. We are the nameless heroes in the background, don&rsquo;t underestimate ourselves! We are the support behind the heroes of history!! We must remain peaceful and not be inflamed, and in this election we must elect good people! Cheers for Taiwan!</p><p></p><p>05:24 (Jinan Rd.) people: Who are these people on the stage? They can be a human-rights defenders, so did the International Bill of Human Rights. There are also human-rights workers, which is a professional work pretty demands in Taiwan. Participate in a human-rights groups is a good way to become a human-right worker.（Describe about the difference between foundation and association and their sources of funds.)</p><p></p><p>05:20 (QingDao E. Rd.)&nbsp; [Host] The following is 99th speaker, a mister from Longtan.</p><p></p><p>05:19 (QingDao E. Rd.) Student surnamed Yang from the Mech Eng. Dept, Nat&rsquo;l Chin-Yi U of Tech: Hello all, I am one of those people with heavy student debt, and don&rsquo;t really have a good job now. Even without the CSSTA there are already many foreign laborers. I think you&rsquo;ve all heard of that Doraemon story, and Taiwan&rsquo;s Doraemon is democracy and freedom!</p><p></p><p>05:12 (Jinan Rd.) [Ms. Lin, a volunteer from Taiwan Association for Human Rights] Maybe you are also against free trading. Chinese labourers being expolited by the free trading agreements is a point where we can start our discussions. Everyone needs to know what they beliefs are, and hold strong.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>05:11 (QingDao E. Rd) [Student Yang] I study at National Chi Nan University. Today I&rsquo;d like to use the risk management aspect I&rsquo;ve learned to analyze what happens when we open doors to foreign investment: My parents bought the house we live in today for couple million dollars (NTD), now, after urban renewal, it is priced at 27 million dollars. If I am just a normal person without property, how am I supposed to purchase a house, to have a roof over my head? Not to mention those who are burdened with student loans. Once the sudden influx of foreign investment comes in, what will happen to our industries? Some declining industries nowadays have taken slow steps in transforming themselves. When foreign investment forcefully comes in, can we Taiwanese people handle it? Take my uncle as an example, he used to be in the crayon business for Lionart (雄獅), Chinese people wanted to pressure him with crushing capital, but he persevered. But if it&rsquo;s happening here in Taiwan, should we all hang in there like he did? Next, let&rsquo;s talk about democracy. I am very fortunate to be here participating in this movement, having us here supporting one another. We use our tear and sweat to nurture the country. If we don&rsquo;t talk about politics today, at least we are here supporting and building this country. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>05:10 (QinDao E. Rd.) [Host] We supply warm clothes here. We have confirmed that chopping accident (from a knife) occured at Jinan Rd. For all safety, please contact peoples nearby and report safe arrival after you go home. Alright? Next, Student Yang from Yonghe.</p><p></p><p>05:09 (Jinan Rd.) [Ms. Lin, a volunteer from Taiwan Association for Human Rights] Other than the CSSTA, do we have other options? Isn&rsquo;t it strange to sign the agreement due to pressures from China? Even if are pro-CSSTA, many items still need to be carefully scrutinized.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>05:04 (QingDao E. Rd) Central University student Mr Yang: Today we have came up with new values, we should not let the legislative yuan have a lack of transparency anymore. I hope everyone can hold on just a bit more, give them (the government) some more pressure, let them know what they should be doing to help its citizens. We are not just here to sit for a few days, then go home and back to our daily activities with no change. Thank you.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>05:03 (QingDao E. Rd.) Mr. Li, a student studying Physical Education tried to bring some energy to everyone by joking that the president Ma Ying Jeou did not clean his ears properly.</p><p></p><p>05:05 (Jinan Rd.) [Ms. Lin, a volunteer from Taiwan Association for Human Rights] The media describes us as a mob. Let them say what they want, we no longer read them anyway!</p><p></p><p>05:03 (Jinan Rd.) [Ms. Lin, a volunteer from Taiwan Association for Human Rights] After many public hearings, we have worked very hard. We are sitting here because we do not understand what the CSSTA is about. Appeal to the governement through the usual means does not work, so we still have to sit here, it is an unusal thing,&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>05:02&nbsp;&nbsp; (QingDao E. Rd.) [host] We are now serving breakfast, please come over if you would like some. Now let&rsquo;s welcome Mr. Li to the stage.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>05:00 (Jinan&nbsp; Rd.) [Ms. Lin, a volunteer from Taiwan Association for Human Rights] I&nbsp; was in the furniture business and had participated in the public hearing&nbsp; concerning retail industries. The leading party had representatives who&nbsp; are pro-agreement, and he opposition party likewise brought opposite&nbsp; side of the picture. However, during the hearing we only heard&nbsp; propaganda but nothing of the impact assessment. The pro-agreement side&nbsp; was just there reading the agreement clauses, and those who are pro&nbsp; service agreement are usually big name enterprises; the opposition&nbsp; raised many questions. What is the meaning of such public hearings?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>04:57 (QingDao E. Rd.) [speech of Mr. Wang from New Taipei City] ... I am luckier. I have a car, own a house and have good salary. But today many people cannot even get a minimum wage ...(omitted) Does it help for us being polite and calm? Does it help if you endure and work hard? The young generation are facing different problem than those we did.</p><p></p><p>04:49 (Jinan Rd.) [A Taipei citizen Hsieh Tzu-Ping speaking] I believe unseating a president is very difficult. How can it be so difficult for us to revoke the power we gave them? If it was easier to revoke their power, politicians would not be able to turn a deaf ear to the public . Why don&rsquo;t we make it easier?</p><p></p><p>04:43 (Jinan Rd.)

Our civil movement doesn&rsquo;t seem to affect the government much.

Road): [speaker]&nbsp;</p><p>18:39 (Conference Hall): [voiceover] We have heard from a newspaper, we are aware that water canon truck has been mobilized. There&rsquo;s huge police force being mobilized. NTU hospitals and nearby hospitals have activated the emergency mechanism for Mass Casualty Incident. We are non-violent protest, yet hospital has been asked to activate MCI mechanism. It suggests that they might take action against the students. Even though the battle line has been extended, we believe, as long as we bind together, we can get our demands responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>18:36 (Conference Hall): Retaking Legislative Yuan is processing for 106 hours from March 17.</p><p>18:35 (Qingdao E. Road): Speaker: You can see this building on Qingdao E Road. It was used to trial the political dissidents during the White Terror. He (his/her grandfather) has been arrested here. I found out about this later. My grandpa&rsquo;s relative was sentenced to jail because he [relative] took my grandpa in. After the release, his property was all confiscated. His family has gone. And also what happened in Meili Dao (Beautiful Island) Incident. There were many being oppressed. Today, we are here at this location, fighting for democracy. This has great significance. Let&rsquo;s give some support to these students.&nbsp;</p><p>18:27 (Qingdao E. Road): Speaker: There are 20 or so professors like me who are participating in this. Before, I&rsquo;ve warned the students not to be taken advantage of in this type of events. I later regretted much. Recently, there was a big anti-nuclear power rally, there were many things going on. We had some physical contact with the police in front of the Taiwan Power Building, but there was no major incident. This time, however, the incidents with physical contacts have been used by certain media maliciously. This is a big lesson for me. I&rsquo;m very glad that many high school students have joined. I was also involved in this type of movement around that age.&nbsp;</p><p>18:20 (Qingdao E. Road): Disconnect. Restore in 18:23.</p><p>18:17 (Conference Hall) [Student Lin Fei-Fan] <u>The following is the 6pm Press Conference on 3/21 inside the Taiwan Parliament.&nbsp;</u></p><p>We have 3 demands. 1) Ma should be fully responsible and respond to all three demands; Wang should respond directly and not engage in under-the-table negotiation. 2) Ma should respond to our request of rescinding the service trade agreement, and keep the meeting agenda for this session 3) If the ruling party does not respond to our demands by 12 AM, we would rally the people to sit in and surround the KMT Party offices throughout the nation.&nbsp; We would rally more people to come to occupy the Legislative Yuan, increase the level of protest.&nbsp;</p><p>We believe we have all heard that Jin Fu-Tsong (金溥聰) has returned to Taiwan. It is said that NTU Hospital and National Defense Medical Center have received the request from Ma administration to activate the emergency mechanism for Mass Casualty Incident. Some people also took the picture of riot fire trucks with water cannons. The military police has been mobilized at large number. If Ma administration chooses to respond to the people with state violence, we feel disappointed. Guys, let&rsquo;s say: &quot;Occupy the Congress&quot; &quot;We will not retreat&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>We have not heard from the Ma administration (unable to transcribe due to noises)</p><p>We have declared to people that the 500 of us will continue to sit in here. If ... increase our level of protest. I believe we are all very tired. Now on Qingdao E Road, there are tens of thousand of people guarding us. There are also many on Jinan Rd who are sitting in, protecting us. Don&rsquo;t panic, okay?

Today, we&rsquo;re fighting for our own future for the rest 90%!</p><p>17:24 (Conference Hall) [voiceover] We will check and examine the people entering the Hall.</p><p>17:17 (Qingdao E.

Take workers who commit suicides on train rails for example, no one wants to be in that position. They are doing it for survival. When you see news like this the next time, please try to understand the cause.</p><p>17:11 (Qingdao E. Road) Evaluation from Japan: Awful statistics, which suggest it would be as if agriculture in Japan is under the trade pact and that means death. Future crops will entirely rely on import. Taiwan has a very similar agricultural construction to Japan&rsquo;s.</p><p>17:10 (Conference Hall) [vocieover] Maybe no entry to the Conference Hall again later.</p><p>17:10 (Conference Hall) [voiceover] Occupying Conference Hall is processing for 105 hours.

We cannot be another HK or Macau... (signal out)</p><p>14:47 (Jinan Rd.) Dadi Bookstore (大地書坊): This is an instrument used specifically for protesting. Go ahead and smash it anytime.</p><p>14:46 (Jinan) [You XianGai (Transliteration] They are not here, They are in there.</p><p>14:43 (Jinan) &quot;A garden to appreciate heaven&quot;</p><p>14:41 (Jinan) &quot;A garden to appreciate heaven&quot; shows us of a special kind of energy that’s there in the reservation of our earth. Earth, is about sharing. So should democracy be.</p><p>14:35(Qingdao) The third potential is about internet. It very difficult for anyone to monopolize it. While the traditional media exercises self-censorship and stigmatizing strategy, students, your job could be telling a truthful story via internet. The truth. The digital citizen on the net has a potential that would out run any attempt from the state to control the information.</p><p>14:32 (Qingdao) The second potential power of the internet is that it allows people to bridge space and time. Today all of us here are able to receive information on the internet, and exchange information quickly. Students inside and outside the Conference Hall can communicate quickly, and people at home can see what&rsquo;s happening at the Conference Hall live.&nbsp; We are no longer blocked by the buildings, we have bridged the gap of space, and people throughout Taiwan can easily understand what&rsquo;s going on. We need to use this power well.</p><p>14:29 (Qingdao) Prof. Chien of NTU: &quot;Networking and Social movement&quot; A few days ago the press reported that many of you are always on your phones, and that you are disunited. But I think being on your phones is the most important job you can have. You can use new technology to create a student movement unlike what has come before. 5-10 years ago the internet was not so developed, but today information is accessible via the internet. This is the age you live in, and the internet can help you. The internet can help you share messages quickly. There has been a lot of &quot;for dummies&quot; packets floating around on the net, and they told us a lot of what we needed to know. The internet can break the information monopoly. More importantly, the internet is interactive and bidirectional. It can promote the sharing of information between different groups.&nbsp;</p><p>13:39 (Qingdao) Since we never cared about politics, this is exactly the consequence, where the government is run by ugly people. If we don’t step up to stop them, that is the course they will continue to move along. Our friends in there have occupied the house over 100 hours. Few days ago, I thought I would run into a crowd of movements veterans. But I was moved by a scene of a young generation. However, our act to step up was painted as another political dog fight by Ma Ying Jio. He said we was going to negotiate with the Speaker. He is the cause to this drama! We demand them to retract the deal and renegoitate the deal. We will not leave until they step down. We also have something to say to our friends from Hong Knog. You have fought so hard for democracy, something you’d never really had in your hands for over a hundred years. Your action of taking over Zhong Huang, was also stigmatized by Hong Kong and state medias from PRC. When Liang Zheng Ying took office, he didn’t do much other he vacuumed Legislative branch’s authority source. Hong Kong has been fighting so hard. I hope our friends from Taiwan would cheer them up.</p><p>13:37 (Qingdao) We hope our Premier and President respect Taiwan&rsquo;s democracy and freedom. We believe that light can be shined into the black box, so that we can see what&rsquo;s inside.</p><p>13:28 (Conference Hall) [announcement] Hello, please clean the area on my left hand side. Later our lawyers will come and they might need the area. Also a reminder: our civil conference (on deliberative democracy) will end in two minutes, please collect what you have discussed. This is the 101st hour of our activity. Our first civil conference has been short, that&rsquo;s ok if your discussion is not done yet. Ok, our civil conference will end now. Pardon for any chaos during the conference. For leader of every group: if you have collected your conclusion, please hand them to me.</p><p>13:25 (Qingdao) Chant slogan: hant slogan: Defend democracy; return CSSTA. Prof. Liang from Dept. of Political Science at Cheng Kung University: If you have a sunflower please raise it. We want to tell the government that if you don&rsquo;t listen to us we will call on the sun and punish you inthe name of the sun (laughs). Our graduate students from Nat&rsquo;l Cheng Gong Uni. is inside Parliament right now. Over the past few days the occupiers have been described as &quot;violent hooligans&quot;, but we&rsquo;ve been here calmly and rationally discussing why the government is lying to us. I am here to speak on whether Taiwan will become another Hong Kong. My answer is yes. Our enemy has over 1,000 missiles trained on us, but they wish to conquer us without firing one shot. HK is supposed to be &quot;one country, two systems&quot; but it&rsquo;s looking more and more like it&rsquo;s been unified under China. HK&rsquo;s main streets are filled with stores selling jewelry and luxury goods such as LV, and servicing Chinese customers, because HK is tax-free in that area. Chinese tourists go there for two days then go home.&nbsp; Right now a lunch box in HK can cost as much as HKD$250, and rent has skyrocketed, with people forced to live in bird cages, 50 people crammed into a space less than 25 pings in size. I&rsquo;ve been in Taiwan for over a decade and like this place more and more. Why is this a sunflower revolution? The CSSTA was drafted inside a black box, we&rsquo;re against that lack of transparency, but we are not necessarily anti-CSSTA. We should think more about the CSSTA itself and why we might be against it. There are too many quid pro quos under the table. Opening the financial industry will allow Chinese banks to access your personal information via credit bureaus. Chinese communication firms can buy out Taiwanese firms, and Chinese firms with military links such as Huawai will supplant us&nbsp; and supervise our&nbsp; speech. Manager Liu of HK Mingpo was attacked because he wrote about the oversea deals of Chinese poiticians, his life</p><p>&nbsp;is in danger. Furthermore, if Chinese advertising and publishing enters Taiwan they can threaten the media by withdrawing advertising dollars. All HK reporting on the Tiananmen incident were withdrawn by media outlets, and their authors weren&rsquo;t consulted.&nbsp;</p><p>13:25 (Qingdao) Three students registered for citizen forum, please come to the front of stage.</p><p>13:20 (Jinan Rd.) Land requisition is totally not necessary. With Dapu Borough protest, we could know that the government did not set a free market as they told those big financial groups. Instead, they took every single land from the underpriviledged minority, even a six-square-footage land was not reserved at last. What would you say...(message interrupted)</p><p>13:17 (Jinan Rd.) I despite you Jin Fu-Tsong. You should just stay in the United States and do not come back. Stop bullshit!</p><p>13:16 (Jinan Rd.) I&rsquo;m telling you, my friends, that&nbsp; rationality is with us. No governor can insult it in our faces.&nbsp;</p><p>13: 14 (Jinan Rd.) I was really pissed off when seeing Jin Fu-Tsong said that we are mobs this morning. I replied immediately that we are not mobs. I&rsquo;ve never said any dirty word, but I did this morning. One word I said. Fuck, I said Fuck.</p><p>13:13 (Conference Hall) [announcer] We are collecting the discussion conclusions</p><p>13:13 (Conference Hall) [announcer] Please continue your discussion until 13:30. Also we&rsquo;d like to ask the leader of each desk (group) to collect your conclusion. Right now we might not have enough time to have the leader of each group to talk about their conclusion. We&rsquo;ll see how we can present to everybody our conclusions - possibly via fan (facebook?) page.</p><p>13:04 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [Prof. from Kaohsiung Normal Univ. giving speech] If we thin If we thin If we thin If we thin If we thin If we thin If we thin If we thin</p><p>12:45 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [speech continues] International Trade can affect both countries. Some people (in the society) may benefit from it and some might be harmed. There should be compensation for those who are at disadvantageous for it, so there could be fairness and justice. Economical development does not bring us democracy, but it&rsquo;s the other way around - democracy brings us economical development.</p><p>12:40 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [Prof. from Dept. of politics, NTU giving a speech] When the executive departments and the Parliament is not fulfilling their duty, citizen participation become really important. We stand out to make our lives better. In modern world, trade agreements are pretty common. But now the executive departments and the Parliament are not fulfilling their duty, but only telling us it&rsquo;s very important to pass the agreement (omitted example about the US and Korea)</p><p>12:35 (Jinan Rd.) [speech} We don&rsquo;t want to become the same as China. What&rsquo;s the most important to Taiwan is democracy and being a state of law. But now some of the legislator (congressmen) now is not following the law. Our parents are worried about us (our safety). But we can tell them: You can be proud of us! We are now all able to think critically and stand here.</p><p>12:22 (Ching-Ta</p><p>o E. Rd.) Lecture on possible replacement of capitalism</p><p>12:02 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Four professors from Nat&rsquo;l Taiwan Univ. are giving lectures.</p><p>11:51 (Ching-Tao) [announcer] Calling the Parliament Process Committee don&rsquo;t block the voice from society the draft agreement of two sides into negotiations.</p><p>11:50 (Jinan) When we heard how the CSSTA was passed we were incredulous, it&rsquo;s unimaginable. What we really need to defend is the trust between people. We must unite. We will not become another HK or Macau.</p><p>11:48 (Jinan Rd.) We are luckier than most because we have passionate teachers. Many people wanted to write their names on the clouds, but here we see so many people willing to write their names on this land. I love Taiwan.</p><p>11:46 (Conference Hall) People are now dividing into groups, seems like there are 22 groups.</p><p>11:46 (Ching Tao) [announcer] A pact is something that will affect the sovereignty of Taiwan, such a pact must be ratified&nbsp; in Parliament, and should pass through a referendum. Only then can the President sign it. Also, we are a country, we do not recognize &quot;one country 2 areas&quot; and when we speak of &quot;cross-strait&quot; we are speaking of the PROC and the ROC. Changing our name or not is something for the future. We respect the sovereignty of the two countries across that Taiwan Strait.</p><p>&nbsp;11:?? (Conference Hall) [Lecture of Prof. Huang, Summary] Prof. Huang talk about how an agreement like CSSTA is usually being discussed in a democratic country. One way is that before negotiating with other country, the executive departments ask for permission from the parliament about what they are allowed to negotiate on. Of course, it&rsquo;s important that for other countries to know we can actually negotiate with them. Therefore a good strategy is that the executive departments presents the situation to the parliament regularly, so let the Parliament can present their opinion all the time. Another method is that executive department negotiate first, and ask the Parliament to review the result. In both case, it&rsquo;s important to respect the Parliament.</p><p>Now our government asks for the whole agreement to be voted at a time (asking the Parliament to either accept all the terms or not). Now in general, even if you choose the first method, the Parliament might decide some of the result (of the negotiation) is not acceptable - this is exactly what&rsquo;s happening for the trade agreement between the US and Korea and for that of US and Columbia. So we see that the third method (what the government is doing) is even more dangerous ... (to be completed)</p><p>11:28 (Jinan Rd.) Reminding: the police are doing a shift change now. They&rsquo;ll move around. It&rsquo;s no need to panic.</p><p>11:17 (Jinan Rd.) [speech] I am here since Tuesday. And I haven&rsquo;t gone home so far. I see so many people here. I am very touched. Thank you! I see our country is hopeful. Thank you for being here to protect our warriors inside (Parliament)</p><p>11:14 (Jinan Rd.) Why is this passing without them thinking of us? Last night, after the Meilidao protest I came straight up here. My college elder works in Shanghai, he told me that Chinese people think we&rsquo;re foolish. I want them to know we are not foolish, if we don&rsquo;t understand something we will try to and something we will try to understand it.</p><p>11:13 (Jinan Rd.) Attorney Lai: The most dangerous night, the 18th, the danger wasn&rsquo;t that the police threatened to enter, they attempted 4 times. I asked the protesters to stand up and shout at the police, telling them they should not arrest students, if they arrest students we will charge inside, and they retreated. But we were a unified group, and that gave us our strength. If we have no command, some may charge and some may not, some goes east and others go west, we cannot act as a group. We were effective precisely because we were unified and acted in concert. So let us continue to act in concert!</p><p>11:0? (Conference Hall) [civil conference] Next, we invite ?? (missed) to explain what is deliberative democracy . Thanks to everybody. Most of the people have been here for a long time. It&rsquo;s touching that you&rsquo;re still here. Why are we here? There is a country which is to sign an trade agreement, but not wanting it to be carefully unbiasedly reviewed. If not because of student and civil groups, would there be even more than two public hearings? In the beginning we ask for public hearing. Then, after the agreement is presented to the Parliament, is it reviewed following the rule/law? We had to occupy this place. It (the review of CSSTA) need an amount of time. For deliberative democracy and about other problems in Taiwan ... at Hong Kong they are unable to elect their president until now. They are now trying to fight for their right to do so in 2017. They have movement simialr to us ... We have to apologize to people here, the environment here is not good. We don&rsquo;t have air condition. We also have to prevent from suspicious people to come here, so we need many volunteers. A good process is that we need some diversity and discussion. Now many opinions against the government are around, but does the government follow? Do they give us more report on CSSTA? Do they try to listen to us? Frankly speaking, we may not come to an agreement today. But we can try hard, and set up an example.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I want to talk about the schedule. Prof. Huang will give us a short lecture on the detail of CSSTA. After our two professors&rsquo; short lectures, we&rsquo;ll divide ourselves into groups. We also need our friends from media to help us. Can we keep working hard until 2 pm (Rmk: they must be very sleepy...bless them) After that we&rsquo;ll take a rest and collect the conclusion of about twenty different groups. If you have any questions (regarding CSSTA), please tell us and we&rsquo;ll record them.</p><p></p><p>11:10 (Ching Tao) Prof. Chiu Wen-tsong is speaking on the draft Cross-Strait Pact Formation Law; this draft has the support of many scholars in law, and sociology. He is speaking on how this draft could solve the current procedural issues regarding trade pacts with China.</p><p>11:06 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) Street classroom: On the immigration of technology talents, of foreign capital, could liberalization of trade cause our service industry to further suffer? Today we are not only here to defend democracy, we are also deciding on what our core values are.</p><p>11:06 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) Street classroom: competition via price-cutting seemed to be good for consumers, but will result in wage depression. Dowe want our wages further depressed? Are our wages not low enough? The CSSTA affects everyone.</p><p>11:05 (Jinan Rd.) A psychology experiment: sharing a cake among a group; if one person only got one slice but you got three, please raise your hand if you would share your extra slices. This is what democracy is all about, we are willing to share resources with others. If we reviewed the situation we would share the cake equitably. In the beginning psychologists assumed people are selfish, but they discovered that people tend to be equitable. We might share a slice of cake with a stranger, or 2 slices with someone we know, but the CSSTA was negotiated in a black box, the cake being shared is bound to be unfair.</p><p>11:04 (Jinan Rd.) [announcer] We received twenty coats - if you&rsquo;ll cold you can come and get them.</p><p>11:01 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) [street classroom] Even without the CSSTA many Taiwanese people have moved to China to work. This cannot be counted as the benefit of the CSSTA, and the government should be ashamed for this, but instead they are calling it a success that stemmed from the CSSTA.</p><p>10:59 (Jinan Rd.) [speech] Why do we come here? We keep sharing what&rsquo;s happening to our friends. We come because we love Taiwan too much. This is a beautiful land. It&rsquo;s beautiful everywhere. We want to tell you: at this moment you&rsquo;re here, protecting not only your own future, but also those who are unable to come here, you parents and all Taiwanese. only if I know there are still so many here so can I have a good sleep. It&rsquo;s an important moment - we should come and fight together.</p><p>10:58 (Jinan Rd.) Parliament is now really surrounded. We will wait one more hour for the government to respond.&nbsp; We will wait here for the dark clouds to dissipate.</p><p>10:57 (Jinan Rd.) Slogan &quot;70% of the people wants the CSSTA being reviewed word by word!&quot;</p><p>10:50 (Jinan Rd.) We voted for the president and these legislators, have they done their duty to us who still have to work?</p><p>10:48 (Jinan Rd.) [speech] I had a nightmare - my mother is cooking, and find the rice made of plastic ... and Taiwan becomes a &quot;region.&quot; And the media talks only about where to have fun. My grandparents come from China, but still, I am against the CSSTA.</p><p>10:45 (Conference Hall) [speech from a student] Hello I am a student from Taipei Univ. We are going to have a civil conference on CSSTA. It will begins at 11. We need to have plans for the conference. So we want to ask for team members to come here first. We&rsquo;ll announce how everybody can help organize the activity soon. If you want to particpate, please sit closer to the stage (arranging seats) We&rsquo;ll explain soon why we are holding this conference. Now Prof. Huang and Prof. ?? (unclear) will give us short lectures. Let&rsquo;s do our best.</p><p>10:44 (Jinan Rd.) To Szechuan disaster sufferers: sorry, I am late. I hope President Ma would also say to us &quot;sorry, I am late&quot; and stop telling legislators &quot;it&rsquo;s on you (to force the CSSTA through)&quot; Why don&rsquo;t you come here and put it to us instead? He ran so roughshod over everything earlier; if the CSSTA is good why are we against it? Today the government says we do not understand the CSSTA. Well, we would like to ask the government if they understand democracy. Today we will have a class for the government, to let them know what democracy is. Finally, be safe, and don&rsquo;t get chills.</p><p>10:40 (Jinan Rd.) You say we don&rsquo;t understand CSSTA, well, report on the CSSTA and stop reporting crap news. I heard that you have to draw numbers to come speak here. I say, do what you need to do! Don&rsquo;t let our microphone be taken away by the government. You are here, in the cold, I would like to be able to tell you to go home, but the government is not letting us go home. We will stay here because the will of the people is with us.</p><p>10:38 (Jinan Rd.) A blind spot of the voting mechanism: Europe is now making a drive for consensus democracy, because they have been through two world wars. A good thing adequately explained should win support from all, no one is so foolish as to oppose something good. You are unfortunately still living under the remnants of the past... (signal breakup) ... Chinese people are diligent? No. They don&rsquo;t pay National Health Insurance, they&rsquo;ll have ten people using one ID card (to take advantage of NIH). We are against this unsustainable culture, and we apologize that we, the baby boom generation, are short-sighted and were unable to provide a sustainable culture for you.</p><p>10:33 (Conference Hall) [announcer] The Civil Conference is for more of us to understand democracy. We welcome more people to come and be with us. My fellow students, we appreciate your efforts, please give your selves a round of applause!</p><p>I have been here so long that days have become blurry. Many of the volunteers have napped at around 7 or 8 and now wake up not knowing what&rsquo;s going on. I know many of your are very sleepy, but I would like to say it is thanks toyou that this activity could succeed. Thanks to you outside we don&rsquo;t feel alone inside. Thank you for persevering inside. Today is a key day. We know that it is raining outside, and this morning I stepped out of Parliament for the first time, I went to the Ching Tao Rd. area and saw that many supporters aren&rsquo;t dressed warmly enough, they did not expect the temperature to drop like this. Seeing so many supporters, so many volunteers helping with the donated materials, they&rsquo;ve all been here three days. I would like you all to give our supporters outside a great round of applause and yell out &quot;Thank you for your hard work!&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>10:16 (Conference Hall) [announcer] We are handing over little cards. The content are provided by lawyer friends. We invite lawyer Mr. Lin to explain to us. [Lawyer Mr. Lin] This card is about that you might be taken away at any time. No matter where you&rsquo;re taken, you should say &quot;I want my lawyer.&quot; How do find a lawyer? you can find 0225231178, 0233938666, and 0225592119. We have people standby to help people in need - we have more than 260 lawyer volunteers. You can remain silent before your lawyer comes. And you can always request for food, water or restroom. Also remember our goal for a peaceful movement. Remember not to curse them.</p><p>10:11 (Jinan Rd.) [speech] If you don&rsquo;t care about politics, the penalty you get is to be governed by terrible people. Everything like the price of our everybody meal is about politics. We have to stand out, and show our power!</p><p>10:09 (Jinan Rd.) [speech] I came this morning, and left. Then while I was on the way, I returned and came back. I had a feeling like our country is going to be sold. I feel bad if I am not standing out. Thank you, all young friends here.</p><p></p><p>09:54 (Conference Hall) [announcer] Hello students and friends from the media. We need more attention from the media. Right now I am now only here to represent all of us who have worked so hard, but maybe more. We are not always joining civil movement, and why are we here today? We don&rsquo;t really want to be here - nobody wants. Don&rsquo;t we want to have our daily life, reading our books or having dinner with parents? Why are we suffering here? We want to tell President Ma and KMT and their legislators (congressmen) We hope you to come here and listen to us. We are just students, we have no political goal or what to achieve here. We&rsquo;re just a group of students with our ideal and not willing to surrender ... We&rsquo;re the hope of our countries&rsquo; future! Our slogan is still the same &quot;Rescind CSSTA, protect our democracy. Later we&rsquo;ll having our civil conference. Hope all friends inside and oustide (the conference hall) will hold on. It&rsquo;s our day to protect Taiwanese democracy.</p><p></p><p>09:54 (Conference Hall) [announcer] For security team members: please gather here if you&rsquo;re free, we&rsquo;ll use your help.</p><p></p><p>09:50 (Jinan Rd) What is democracy - democracy means even we expect difficulties to come, we need to know how we got us in the situation. The victims have the right to know who made the decisions. We often see South Korea and Singapore as our examples. When Koreans and Singaporeans come to Taiwan and see how we praise their economy, they ask: don&rsquo;t you realize that many people are suffering in our economy? There is nothing that is 100% good or 100% bad. Sometimes some of the population are sacrificed for the rest of the population. Nevertheless, there should be complimenting measures to help those who were sacrificed. Ma&rsquo;s govt fails to do so. There were twice during Ma&rsquo;s term that made me feel really uncomfortable, yet helpless.were twice during Ma&rsquo;s term that made me feel really uncomfortable, yet helpless. The first time was when Chen, Yun-lin came to Taiwan. Many friends were told by the police not to leave their home. (?) It was awkward. But at least, it tells us that the Assembly and Demonstration Act is unconstitutional. I discussed Constitution with my German friends and I felt ashamed. As we were discussing Constitution and democratic values, those who protested against Chen Yun-lin were beaten up. The second time is today. We need to at least give the minority a chance to speak. Even if the majority would win at the voting, you should at least still respect te minority. But today Ma says none of these is necessary.</p><p></p><p>09:47 (Conference Hall) [voiceover] If you want to cook for us, we really appreciate. Please contact the resource team. The Youth Front of Black Island Country team have made a video &quot;I&rsquo;m a Taiwanese&quot; (see top) in English. I hope everybody can share the information around, so that we can inform more people about this information. Right now the number of people in the conference hall is in decline, so we might accept more people coming here. There will be some restriction, but right now people can still come inside.</p><p></p><p>09:45 (Conference Hall) [Announcer] For people&rsquo;s question, if you want to provide resources, please call our resource team. They&rsquo;ll tell you where to put the items. As for where doctors may go and help, please check the facebook page of <a href='https://www.facebook.com/lslandnationyouth'/>Youth Front of Black Island Country </a>. Right now we have enough doctors inside the conference hall. But you may still ask if there are need (in other sites).</p><p></p><p>09:43 (Conference Hall) [voiceover] Nothing big have happened so far since last afternoon. It&rsquo;s raining and cold outside, so for people coming to help us, please take care.</p><p></p><p>09:38 (Conference Hall) [announcer] It&rsquo;s 9:30 am now. I hope everybody slept well last night. There are many nice people who provided us sleeping bags, so we&rsquo;re in a better condition now. Our friends outside (the Parliament) are working even harder; it&rsquo;s raining and cold outside. We appreciate them very much. Later at 11 am we are having a very important activity. So if you&rsquo;re awake here, please collect your sleeping bag and return them to the resource team. Now let&rsquo;s clean around, so we can have a better environment for our conference. After all, this is our Parliament. What we will do later is having our civil conference. We should tell the legislator (congressmen) what is the right way to do this. We hope you can stay and discuss with us.</p><p></p><p>09:32 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [Famous figure of PTT] I have to say I respect you very much. This is my fifth time coming (to such a circumstance?) I feel I have the duty to fight with everybody. I respect you all. You are true heroes.</p><p></p><p>09:31 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [announcer] We are short of volunteers for supporting the medical passage. We want to ask people who are not so tired to go and join them at the white tents at Wonton Cuisine. Good news: From mid-Taiwan 20 buses are coming. If they are not giving us a satisfying answer, we&rsquo;ll keep staying here.</p><p></p><p>09:28 (Conference Hall) [voiceover} We hope people can help us sharing the video &quot;I am a Taiwanese&quot; (see top) with your friends and translate English to other languages (adding subtitles or so), to let people from other countries know what&rsquo;s happening!</p><p></p><p>09:27 (Ching-Tao E. Rd) [A student from Cheng Kung Univ. Dept of Photonics] Apologies that I missed earlier. Actually there have been Cheng Kung Univ students here since the early morning on Thursday. But I know I am here for a purpose - I know people who have been here must be exhausted. I want to make sure that I am alert when I&rsquo;m here. If there is any police action, I hope to offer my body to Taiwan. We are outraged because our wishes were not carried out. We are sad because our voiced were not heard. I really like a song by Eason Chen, I would like to dedicate this song to all our friends here. [Singing Easons&rsquo; Baby Song] I hope that all of us can follow our heart, and continue to do something for our land.</p><p></p><p>09:26 (Conference Hall) [voiceover] Right now student Jiang is have a meeting with journalists on the stage. He will also be the host for our upcoming conference this morning.</p><p></p><p>09:21 (Conference Hall) [voiceover] Right now is 9:27 am, we have occupied the parliament for 97 hours. If everything goes smoothly, we will be hosting a citizen&rsquo;s conference on CSSTA at 11 am.</p><p>deliberation of Citizen on CSSTA.</p><p></p><p>09:12 [Ching-Tao E. Rd.] It has been two days that we occupy the parliament. Again we want to say: we are no violence, and we want to tell everybody what we want: rescind the CSSTA and protect our democracy.</p><p></p><p>09:07 (Conference Hall) [Announcer] We are still in need of the portable toilets at the Ching-tao E. Rd and Jinan Rd. locations. If you can provide some, please contact the resource coordination units of both locations.</p><p></p><p>09:06( Conference Hall)[Announcer] There are hot Americano and other hot&nbsp; drinks at the booth behind, please help yourself. You are also&nbsp; responsible for the rubbish you have produced, please dispose them at the&nbsp; bin provided, thanks.</p><p></p><p>09:05 (Ching-Tao) Uncle Hong: We citizens cannot accept this process (of passing the CSSTA). If the government insists that the CSSTA is good. They need to explain to us. We cannot allow the agreement to be passed with such a manner.</p><p></p><p>08:57 (Meeting Hall) [voiceover] We&rsquo;re still in need of rations, hot food and portable toilets. We need more portable toilets as there are just too much people outside.</p><p></p><p>08:53 (Ching Tao E. Rd) Chang (a participating student): There have been very many social movements in the recent years. I was absent in all of them. Although I know they were about urban planning, but I knew that they could not be only about urban planning. Urban planning are public policies, as is the CSSTA, needs to have broad public participation, and cannot be determined in the hands of few. Urban planning affects hundreds of thousands of property interests, as well as our history and collective memories. Therefore, each individual line drew on the plan should be a result of deliberative consideration. As students we learn to study with mindfulness, then why the grownups fail to treat CSSTA - something that is going to have huge impact on us - with the same mindfulness. Moreover, I have not seen citizen participation in the process, which cannot be represented by a mere dozens of congressmen. We, as citizens, need to get involved and tell them what we need - this is a very important principle of citizen participation. Thank you all for being here, and thank you to those who volunteer and who provided us the needed resources. Thank you very much. We didn&rsquo;t really have other options. It is because these grownups failed their responsibility that we are now obliged to remind them what their responsibilities are. Please stop defaming us.</p><p></p><p>08:53 (Meeting Hall) In order to let this issue to be better understood by the international audience, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/lslandnationyouth'/>黑色島國青年陣線</a><a href='https://www.facebook.com/lslandnationyouth'/>Youth Front of Black Island Country&nbsp;</a></p><p>has produced a short video &quot;I am a Taiwanese&quot; and released it on the Internet.

We want to fight against the government. We are here, at our free will. We don&rsquo;t want to lose our free will to China. I want to say Chinese people people are not bad - I have a Chinese roommate. However, Taiwan cannot be controlled, by China or whatever other country. We&rsquo;re not elites of the society, nor are we doing something great. We&rsquo;re just doing what we should do.</p><p></p><p>08:42 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.)

Thanks to friends in Hawaii. This is a revolt? No we&rsquo;re not going that far. People say this does not happen in, say, the US? Well I suppose people in the US won&rsquo;t allow the Parliament to do ridiculous thing like this. Cheer up, our friends in Taiwan!</p><p></p><p>07:55 (Conference Hall) We wish friends from all around the world can spread the message on a guestbook, or ask friends for supporting. Darned geek? I don&rsquo;t think so. In our recall laws, it suggests that recall must not be propagated. So there is a constitution 305 working on the recall laws. Maybe we are going to have a civics lesson later. It should be fine outside the hall, right? Because if something happens outside, there should be some announcements inside too. Anatomy? Quite important, though it is not my major. Oh, today is a Japanese holiday. Friends in Japan can translate the content of live casting in Niconico for the Japanese friends to understand.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>07:50 (Jinan Rd.) [announcer] Next, we invite our professor from Nat&rsquo;l Tsinghua Univ. to give us a lecture. Summary: Let&rsquo;s think about this, the decision on such a big issue is completely against democracy. In Feb. people from the ministry of economics come to the univ. to talk about CSSTA. When we ask, if there are problems that arise from the CSSTA, do we have anyway to stop it? They say &quot;how will there be problems from CSSTA?&quot; ... If we sign the agreement but China does not follow it, what can we do? ... and they have no answer. We know that agreement need a third party to supervise. Otherwise it could be a useless agreement. Who want such an agreement? The economic relation between Taiwan and China is actually pretty good. So why do we need the CSSTA so hurriedly?</p><p></p><p>07:50(Conference Hall) We will announce here if there are some actions. I heard the Yomiuri News (讀賣新聞) and Asahi News (朝日新聞) have reported, right? But I don&rsquo;t understand anyway. Study well in the courses, because the law is formulated by those who have studied law, too. hmm, you should still study well.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>07:47 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [people from Taitung speaking] I worked until 8 pm yesterday, and took a bus here. My family were against me. They say &quot;does it make a difference if you go or not?&quot; I say &quot;It does,&quot; and left. I am here, because I am a citizen. Without this country there will be no home to live, so I have to protect our country. Protecting this country is protecting our home. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>07:43 (Ching-Tao East) Paul from America: I love Taiwan, I gave up my million dollars pay check and came back here. My mother think I am out of my mind, but I feel that Taiwan has a, I wanted to do my part, She raised me up, and I am coming back. The day before I am home, my mother said I am really crazy. I came back four years ago, I helped people, I believe I can make a difference. I realized my decision was correct, cause it is not just me who loves Taiwan, all of you, everyone loves Taiwan.</p><p></p><p>07:46 (Ching-Tao East) Please don&rsquo;t try to climb in the conference hall through window. That will result in the tension between us and the police.</p><p></p><p>07:46 (Conference Hall) [voiceover] Pulling down the President? That&rsquo;s not what our movement is about. There might be people in the movement shouting many slogans. But our main topic is rescinding the CSSTA and defend democracy.</p><p></p><p>07:44 (Conference Hall) [voiceover] Thanks to people from Europe. Better we can have Taiwan joining the United Nation... well that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s our movement is about.</p><p></p><p>07:43 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Paul the American: I love Taiwan. I gave up million salary just to return to Taiwan. My mom thought I am insane. But I don&rsquo;t think Taiwan is hopeless. I want to contribute to it. It has raised me, and I must return. On the day before returning,&nbsp; my mom said that I am really insane. After I returned 4 years ago, I have been helping people, because I believe that &rsquo;I can make a difference&rsquo;. I found I made a correct decision 4 years ago, because not only I love Taiwan, but also all of you.</p><p></p><p>07:40 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) New announcer is introduced. Also people are welcome to sign up and give a speech.</p><p></p><p>07:40 (Jinan Rd.) Students from Chung-Cheng Univ. are giving speeches.</p><p></p><p>07:38 (Conference Hall) [announcer] Last night the police have taken no actions. We had a good sleep ... This is actually a website on ustream, there people helped create a channel, playing the video there. Thanks to pennychu. If there are friends who speak English, you can answer for me. Also there are a lot of graduate students here. We should encourage them.</p><p></p><p>07:38 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [announcer] The president of Donghua University wrote a public mail, encouraging students to attend this event.</p><p></p><p>07:37 (Ching-Tao E. Rd) a participating student: Our university president said that he is against students&rsquo; taking part in this event. I am here with a sign to tell him: Mr. President, you cannot represent Soochow University.</p><p></p><p>07:36 (Ching-Tao E. Rd) a participating student: I am now 18 years old. In two years I will be able to vote. If I don&rsquo;t take the opportunity to understand my country now, when will I do.</p><p></p><p>07:35 (Conference Hall) [announcer] We use a container to collect what we drain in the toilet? This is used only in certain time. If there are no police officers here inside, going to toilet is more relaxing.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>07.33 (Conference) [Announcer] Those who have not had their breakfast can stay calm, we have had our people to deliver them here immediately; the second batch of breakfast has already arrived. Stay calm and please ensure you have your breakfast. Also, please do not dispose the newspapers, they can be used as cushion or to keep you warm. Please also conserve the environment, dispose the rubbish around you to the nearest bin in order to put us in a better condition for this long fight, thank you everyone.</p><p></p><p>07:26 (Jinan Rd.) [Announcer] The police is doing a shift change. No need to be nervous.</p><p></p><p>07:25 (Jinan Rd.) [Attorney Liu] The reason that the labors could win (Rmk: another civil movement in Taiwan) is because they fight together. We also need to do the same, peacefully, together.</p><p></p><p>07:25 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [Announcer] Students from Nat&rsquo;l Sun Yat-Sen just arrived in two buses.</p><p></p><p>07:22 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [Freddy] The International Policy Organization says that the police should protect the movement, and also the media should provide unbiased report.</p><p></p><p>07:21 (Ching-Tao East) [Announcer] We would like to invite Freddy to explain about the statement released by International Policy Organization on yesterday night.</p><p></p><p>07:19 (Ching-Tao East) [Freedy] Doesn&rsquo;t matter how the CCSTA will be beneficial or not, as long as KMT involved with it will become messed up. Because they are a group we could not trust with their intelligent level. A party we could not trust. So we are welcoming those people who just simply not trust the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>07:16 (Ching-Tao East) The vocalist (Freddy) from the band Cthonic: We people here are ordered and understand the service and trade agreement, and we are willing to understand how people think, regardless approving or disapproving. Can&rsquo;t those who have opposite opinion and those we didn&rsquo;t try to spend time to understand join us? This is a matter of trust. It&rsquo;s like the issue of the 4th nuclear power plant. We can discuss about the 4th nuclear power plant, but not really, because the government cannot build things well. There is a music classroom in Taipei, and another music classroom in Taipei. If our music classroom is going for colaboration with Apa(阿帕) music classroom, we will spend a lot of time discussing in details, to see if both sides benefit from that. But if there is some guy who is much weaker, there is no discussion, because there is no chance to win. Now we don&rsquo;t trust the IQ of our president, but I trust yours more.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>07:15 (Jinan Rd.) Student Chen from Shu-Te Technical University: Many teachers in our university were against us students coming here, because for what we study in the department, the service and trade agreement will bring us a lot of money. Why do you only see the benefit shortly in front of you, but overlook the future? The teacher said to me: &quot;You don&rsquo;t understand. Leave my office.&quot;</p><p></p><p>07:15(Conference Hall) [Announcer] To those who are coming to the parliament, please bring some warm clothing to keep yourself warm, the number of people at the venue will be controlled at approximately 400-500 people. There is no assualt this dawn, and everyone looks quite energetic.</p><p></p><p>07:14 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [speech] Now what we usually can see on the internet is that we need to sign the agreement to make progress, and that we are only afraid of competition. Well, now we stand here, does it look like we are afraid of competition? But we don&rsquo;t want unfair competitions, so that only huge companies and those will have good relationship with the government benefit. Internat&rsquo;l agreement usually result in this kind of problem. Those whoever in power get more benefits. Now it is going to turn into a game in which people compete who is getting along better with the KMT and with the (Chinese) communist party. We hope people will think differently. We want a fair competition, but not something that the big companies always win.</p><p></p><p>07:10 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) Teacher Lin: I&rsquo;ve been her since March 18, and I saw many people here. I was going to take the 12 o&rsquo;clock train back to Shichi, but I couldn&rsquo;t. I eventually went back for work, but returned here after work. I see tens of thousands of people here and I thought that they don&rsquo;t need me, but then I thought, if others thought like me, there would definitely not be so many people here, so I am definitely needed!</p><p></p><p>07:06 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) Teacher Lin from Shichi Primary School: People said that we should leave the stage to the youth. As a teacher, I would like to thank all of you today. We adults and teachers would like to thank you, the youth of our country, for doing this.</p><p></p><p>07:05 (Jinan Rd.) Attorney Lai Zhong-chiang is speaking.</p><p></p><p>07:04 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) [announcer] We received a cup today that says, &quot;Against the CSA? free drink for you.&quot; Previously we saw cups that said &quot;Against the CSA and support the students, NT$0 for your drink.&quot; Many people cannot come but are silently supporting us from where they are.</p><p></p><p>07:03 (Conference Hall) [Announcer] Terrorists? No, we don&rsquo;t have terrorists in here, everyone is cute. Today is Friday, there will be more people :). Outside is getting cold, please be careful and keep yourself warm.</p><p></p><p>07:01 Conference Hall) [announcer] The Internet access inside the hall has improved, and we can now show the webcast from outside the building.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>07:01 (Jinan Rd.) Student: If you see a business owner cursing out the students, he must be a beneficiary of the CSA. The RMB has already fallen, and the government wants to use the CSA to bolster that weakness.</p><p></p><p>07:00 (Lin Shen S. Road, Lane 8) There was a middle-aged woman using a megaphone to provoke the crowd for disturbing the shifting of police. It became peaceful again after she was persuaded to leave.</p><p></p><p>07:00 (Conference Hall) [announcer] Please do not react on some provoking languages. We hope there will not be conflicts and riots today. We shouldn&rsquo;t have riots of course, but the police will tell about conflicts.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:59 (Ching-Tao East) Taipei University Social service student Chen: Everyone has a dream, it might be about you, might be about others, but here today we are here hoping for a better Taiwan. Not just hoping there are less politic struggle, if we don&rsquo;t do something than there is nothing left for us.&nbsp; This is what I want to said to the media, governors...*murmurs* Their eyes are covered with dust and they don&rsquo;t know right now.</p><p></p><p>06:58 (Conference Hall) [announcer] There was an announcement yesterday saying that all the government meetings next week are canceled, other meetings in the parliament might not take place either. We will announce when advanced news arrive.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:57 (Jinan Rd.) [Mr. Yang, who had been in the Parliament for two days] Right now we have put obstructions to at the 8 gates. We have been prepared for attacks (from the police). Every time we hear that there are 20 thousands of people outside we feel very protected.</p><p></p><p>06:56(Conference Hall) [Announcer] (disconnected) Please treasure what is given to you, if you have anything that you need, you are most welcomed to approach us at the inquiry counter, thank you.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:54 (Jinan Rd.) [announcer] Here at Jinan Rd. we stand here because groups of students have taken turns staying here. Please gather more people and hold on!</p><p></p><p>06:53 (Conference Hall) [announcer] Today there will be a meeting of the Office of the president, the Parliament and of the Executive Yuan. Last night there have been some suspicious action outside, but nothing have happened so far.</p><p></p><p>06:50 (Conference Hall) [announcer] Hi everyone! Now there are some people doing things which are just consuming ourselves. Please don&rsquo;t react on that.</p><p></p><p>06:50 (Jinan Rd.) Student from Taiwan College of Arts made ten sunflowers in support. We have many other issues that need your attention.</p><p></p><p>06:50 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) participant: some have asked why we don&rsquo;t just buy our bus tickets, but I believe we should make this known as widely as possible. Some people think we&rsquo;re poking our noses in someone else&rsquo;s business.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:49 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) participant: I saw this two days ago and decided to come up, we were originally going to charter a bus, we had enough people to do that last night, but we don&rsquo;t have enough people this morning.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:48 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) participant: We must defend our country at this juncture, we must not meekly go without resistance.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:47 (Jinan Rd.) Reading newspapers: United Daily News: &quot;The 4th day of occupation in parliament. Ma, Jian, and Wang will meet today for solutions.&quot; Chinatimes: &quot;(reading too fast to follow)&quot;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:41 (Conference Hall) [announcer] (disconnected)) ...need to discuss. So we do a cleaning here at about 10 am. After all this is our Parliament ... (disconnected). Whatever pros and cons there are, our legislators may not do it, so we are sitting here. Thirdly, we&rsquo;ll discuss in detail what a free trade agreement is. This is really a new moment of the history. Usually it should be the Legislators who sit here and discuss. But now it&rsquo;s us sitting here and discussing. We also have our fact sheet, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to come get one. We also have newspaper from Liberty Times, Apple Daily, ...(disconnected). You can discuss with people around you, or wait for our discussion at 11. We&rsquo;re also carefully watching how the government will answer to us. The government will hold a meeting at 11:30. They will discuss ...(disconnected). So we&rsquo;ll wait for their response after that. Ahhh and we&rsquo;re also waiting for our breakfast.</p><p></p><p>06:39 (Conference Hall) [Announcer]: We need plenty of cooked food and rations, please actively supply them to the resource team.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:38 (Jinan Rd.) Reading newspapers: Apple: &quot;This morning: last announcement from the students. Emergency meeting for the president&quot; &quot;Sunflower lights up students social activism&quot; Liberty Times: &quot;Students:&rsquo;Reject the service and trade agreement. Ma and Wang must reply before 12 today&rsquo;&quot; &quot;Opposition party and industry will surround the parliament today&quot;.</p><p></p><p>06:37(Conference Hall) [Announcer] The first batch of breakfast has been given out, please be patient for the second batch.(Smiles)</p><p></p><p>06:32(Conference Hall) [Announcer] Anyone named 鄭雅茹 is in the hall? Your parents are looking for you, please contact them immediately once you read this message. Breakfast is now ready, please give priorities to those who needed it more. To those who are awake, please help cleaning up in order to reduce&nbsp; the crews&rsquo; workload, thank you for your cooperation.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:31 (Conference Hall) [Announcer] There is no assault at dawn, however traffic officers at the external area have changed to security polices.</p><p></p><p>06:25 (Jinan Rd.) Profesor: We don&rsquo;t need a representative in politics anymore, we can show our will through the Internet. We need only come out when our country is sick. Is our judiciary fair? Look at the (corporal) Hung Jong-chiu case.</p><p></p><p>06:13 Student surnamed Lu: We cannot give up here. If we give up here, the KMT will believe we&rsquo;ve given up, people will believe we&rsquo;ve given up,&nbsp; that don&rsquo;t need additional help here.&nbsp; People are tired but dawn is coming and it will get warm soon. Our struggle here has meaning.</p><p></p><p>06:13 (Jinan Rd.) announcer is leading the group in morning exercises.</p><p></p><p>06:12 (Jinan Rd.) Paper sheet: I am an alumni from Tzu Chi University. I am studying in the field of third catagory (biology, medicine...). I am happy to take this civics lesson with everyone. Everyone here is a teacher, speaking out for those who are at home. The government owes us an apology. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>06:12 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) Student surnamed Lu from Nat&rsquo;l Tsing Hua U. Dept Humanities: Our senior Chen Wei-ting is inside, and it&rsquo;s raining now. Even the heavens are crying. We are here to fight for democracy. Many senior citizens are asking us why we chose violence, why can&rsquo;t we talk this out? Well, if someone is running away with your bowl of noodles what would you do? Would you call the police or run after the thief? Of course you would run, you wouldn&rsquo;t call the police because it would be too late. This is why we&rsquo;re here, sharing with all of you what President Ma is thinking, why has there been no response after all this time, and why he wants the CSSTA to pass. The government wants more of us to show up, so that we can be chips in the card game with China.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:10 (Jinan Rd.) student surnamed Lee: No one can fight for so long without rest. We are only students, and we only want our government to provide us with the assurances we need.</p><p></p><p>06:09 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) [announcer] Quite a few of us contributed their phone chargers to help those inside. Volunteers will be collecting those chargers and calling out names, please pick up your charger when your name is called. If you are leaving but you haven&rsquo;t gotten your charger back, don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll keep it safe for you.</p><p></p><p>06:08 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) [announcer] Please call on your friends to act and participate. People get tired and we need support from our friends in the central and southern parts of Taiwan.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:07 (Conference Hall) [announcer] Some people have lost their cell phones or tablet PCs, so please take care of your personal belongings. This hasn&rsquo;t happened over the past few days so we don&rsquo;t quite know how to deal with this situation. Please beware of your personal belongings, especially cell phones and wallets. Also help the people around you take care of their things, and if you see someone sleeping, watch their things for them. Please also be on the lookout for the lost tablets and phones, thank you!</p><p></p><p>06:07 (Jinan Rd.) Taiwan Univ. of Arts student Lee: many have been asking what we are protesting against. We want the government to put on a condom, we don&rsquo;t want to get screwed like this.</p><p></p><p>06:07 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [announcer] The atmosphere for inside and outside are quite different. People outside are important - the more people outside, the safer the people inside are.</p><p></p><p>06:05 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [announcer] There are many things that made us touched. There are all different kind of resources inside, sanitary napkins, contact lenses of all strengths. This shows the power of citizens. That&rsquo;s how when our will gather together, we can change our society.</p><p></p><p>06:05 (Conference Hall) [voiceover] It&rsquo;s now 6:05, the 94th hours for us. Thanks to everybody!</p><p></p><p>06:05 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) [announcer] I only see my sister in Kaohsiung three or four times a year, because she is working hard at a job that only pays NT$22k/month. If we sign the CSSTA today we might all be working 22k jobs. Is this the optimistic future you want? Is this the CSSTA you want?</p><p></p><p>06:03 (Jinan Rd.) Taipei University Grad School of Law student surnamed Lee: Why is this protest filled with young people? This is because we are angry and capable, and I hope that in the future we do not forget why we came out today.</p><p></p><p>06:03 Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Participant: the government has the same consistent attitude: to make money. I hope we will continue to care about these issues in the future.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>06:02 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [speech] We see so many people standing out. We are very touched. We also want to say there are many citizen movement, like about Dapu　incident, and about against the fourth nuclear power plant. In these cases, the government all only want money. We hope and need everybody to keep their concerns on these issues.</p><p></p><p>06:00 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Marine Dept. student surnamed Chang: We should not view fairness between states as the fairness that everyone should strive for. We should rather see the inequities in our society, and see how to address them, to improve everyone&rsquo;s lives.</p><p></p><p>06:00 (Conference Hall) 4-6am shift signing off. Good work everyone.</p><p></p><p>05:57 (Conference Hall) Voiceover: By 93 hours, we count from the hour after the deal was prounced passed by the committee.</p><p></p><p>05:57 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Marine Dept. student surnamed Chang: &quot;Fair&quot; is actually a complex issue. How do we determine fairness? What&rsquo;s the difference between fairness for a Taiwanese worker and a Chinese worker? How do we prove fairness?</p><p></p><p>05:56 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Marine Dept. student surnamed Chang: What is fair and equitable? Many people talk about Taiwan&rsquo;s economy and its growth, but that growth does not mean that people are living better. If something is better for the Taiwanese economy, does that mean it&rsquo;s better for the Taiwanese people?</p><p></p><p>05:54 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Marine Dept. student surnamed Chang: ... and some may say that politics and economics are separate. I think they are mainly inseparable. In many industries Chinese capital is allowed to invest in Taiwan directly. What does this mean? It means if relationships change they can withdraw capital and Taiwanese people will be out of jobs. 40% of Taiwanese economy is service-related, this will render us powerless to resist changes they want to impose.</p><p></p><p>05:53 (Jinan Rd.) [announcer] Welcome everybody to come to the stage and speak to us! If you are shy, you can write what you want to say on a note, and we can speak loud for you.</p><p></p><p>05:52 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Marine Dept. student surnamed Chang: Before I came here today I told my father, and he said he understands, and supports my decision, but that I should know why I&rsquo;m coming here. So a spent a few hours examining the STA. And when I started to think about it, the document made me afraid. The document specified industries Taiwan is opening to China and China is opening to Taiwan, but areas where Taiwan is opening up to China has no limitations imposed, while in areas where China is opening up to Taiwan there are clear restrictions and definitions. This is very unfair, and I am very worried. We may say that politics is indivisible from economics....</p><p></p><p>05:50 (Conference Hall) We are heading into the 93rd hour. HOT FOOD is still in short supply. In addition, we are looking for more portable toilets.</p><p>05:49 (Conference Hall) Please help on the resource in need, as indicated in Facebook page <a href='https://www.facebook.com/lslandnationyouth'/>黑色島國青年陣線</a> (Chinese).</p><p></p><p>05:48 (Conference Hall) [voiceover] If you can provide rain gears, please bring them to the resource team.</p><p></p><p>05:47 (Ching-Tao E.

We have NOT yet been able to confirm that information.</p><p></p><p>05:08 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [announcer] If we can just sleep in the bed, none of us will be here. Let&rsquo;s not remember: we sit here because inside the Parliament we have hundred of friends who need our support. We&rsquo;ll just sit here if the police take no action. But if they do, we have to be the shield for those who are inside.</p><p></p><p>05:07 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [announcer] We thank students from Nat&rsquo;l Sun Yat-Sen Univ.. They&rsquo;ve came here from such a far place (a.k.a Kaohsiung). Now it&rsquo;s raining harder and harder. Please make sure you are equipped with rain gear, and keep yourself warm.

[continues] The police can have their shift change, but we have to sacrifice daily life. Now we ask for the political figures to show up. After all, the salary they receive come from us. We need more famous people in the society to join us, so our movement can be more influential.</p><p></p><p>04:55 (Conference Hall) [Announcer] We need hot food and prepared food here in the conference hall. Will someone get some here? Many Thanks!</p><p></p><p>04:54 (Ching - Tao E. Rd.) [Announcer] We are now giving our raincoats, please beware and don&rsquo;t catch a cold everyone. Please put on your raincoat quickly, our protest must go on a long way. Everyone please take a raincoat and take care of yourself.</p><p></p><p>04:51 (Jinan Rd.) [A person who just came out from the Parliament] I am a person who climbed in in the second day. I am not a student. Originally we want to put the CSSTA back into discussion. Eventually it turns out we want to draw the attention of people in Taiwan to the problem of our Parliment and political system.</p><p></p><p>04:51 (Conference Hall) Voiceover: Items currently in short supplies include CABBAGES, EGGS, COOKED RICE, and huge amount of HAND-HELD HOT FOOD, AND BISCUITS.</p><p></p><p>04:50 (Conference Hall) Voiceover: Ji-nan Rd.

[students from Chung-Cheng Univ.] I am working as a reporter, though I&rsquo;ve never spoke in front of so many people. Most mainstream media will try to report negatively on us. But we know we are working hard to protect the democracy, but not some mobs. As I&rsquo;ve also worked in a main stream media. I&rsquo;ve try my best and written articles reporting injustice of the society. But they just tell me I am too young. I think we need to report what the mainstream media doesn&rsquo;t want to report. I hope I&rsquo;ll always stand with citizens. Please, I ask you to support independent medias.</p><p></p><p>04:32 (Lin-Sen S. Rd Lane 8) [Live stream broadcaster Mr. TS] Now I am going to Chin-Tao E. Rd. to film the current situation. Most of the people in Lane 8 are resting now, I be back in a minute.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>04:32 (Conference Hall) Voiceover: The situation on Lin-sen S.

[students from Chung-Cheng Univ.] We are now feeling really bad about the mainstream media. Even though the media has been pretty bad, there are still people working there who want to make a change. Many people work in the media want to report on CSSTA, but they are asked to work on other topics. It&rsquo;s really sad. So we need media that are independent and belongs to the citizen. We want to recommend <i>Civilmedia</i> and the website <i>coollound.</i></p><p></p><p>04:27 (Conference Hall) Voiceover: Apple Broadcast feed has been rebooted. Please press F5. (note: it&rsquo;s another video feed, not the phone maker).</p><p></p><p>04:23 (Conference Hall) Voiceover: The situation on Lin-sen S. Rd. has been resolved. [and then there&rsquo;s girly chit-chat... sounds cute lah).</p><p></p><p>04:20 (Jinan Rd.) [students from Chung-Cheng Univ.] In our univ., we are now having lectures and seminars on issues regarding the CSSTA.</p><p></p><p>04:20 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [announcer] We still need everybody. Also please help our volunteer to clean the site. And please keep the passage free, thank you.</p><p></p><p>04:18 (Jinan Rd.) [announcer] In this hour, let us talk about why we&rsquo;re here. What can we make a change on?</p><p></p><p>04:16 (Jinan Rd.) [announcer] Our activity and our facility are supported by so many different citizen groups. They collect resource and contribute to us.</p><p></p><p>04:14 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [Chairman Chang] We only want the government to do something right. We want Wang Jing-Ping to let go of this. And let&rsquo;s see, the manager of those huge companies only care about money for themselves and their families. But do they care about the future of Taiwan? It&rsquo;s because of us why their company make money. Now we gather here, with more and more people, and we have to let them know that people all over the world are looking at the event. This is history, and a peaceful event. We have to hold on.</p><p></p><p>04:14 (8th Lane, Linsen S. Rd.) [Apple Daily] Security teams are still alert around the passage.</p><p></p><p>04:13 (Jinan Rd.) [Chinese-speaking people from Philippine] Taiwan is a very beautiful place. It&rsquo;s a star among Chinese-speaking regions. We don&rsquo;t want bad things to happen to it.</p><p></p><p>04:12 (8th Lane, Linsen S. Rd.) [Apple Daily] The discussion is finished. The conclusion is that people not going to block the passageway.</p><p></p><p>04:11 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [Chairman Chang] Now people from all the Taiwan have gathered, and even from Japan. I am very touched. You&rsquo;re the hope of Taiwan&rsquo;s future.</p><p></p><p>04:11 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [announcer] Please keep going on. Right now we have volunteers cleaning trashes - please also help them. Also please maintain the passage free. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>04:08 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) Chairman Chang: I left Taiwan&nbsp; a long time ago. From the outside, Taiwan is truly a &quot;treasure island&quot;. We are self-sufficient and managed to put ourselves at the height of economic prosperity, despite being a small island. But today, even as the head of a small business, I consider myself a student - learning never ends. Our government lacks the ability for introspection, and the procedure around the CSSTA is clearly not transparent, in a black box.</p><p></p><p>04:06 (Conference Hall) (4am shift reporting for duty, nothing much is going on.) Voiceover: This is the 92th hour since we took over the Parliament. We ran into connection issue ealier and reset the connection shortly.</p><p></p><p>04:05 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [announcer] Hello everybody, I&rsquo;ll be the new announcer. Right now we see more and more people joining us. Please avoid pushing each other, and find places to sit down as soon as possible, otherwise it might bring troubles to our team members. Thanks!</p><p></p><p>04:03 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [student from Chung-Hua Univ.] We want to thank our president (of the university)</p><p></p><p>04:03 (Jinan Rd.) [Female poet] We women are afraid of sexual harassment and assault as we are afraid of the CSSTA and what Chang Ching-Chung did. My boss told me &quot;stop writing - just go to the congress and stand with the students.</p><p></p><p>04:02 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) We heard fireworks earlier, would the security team please take a look? The earlier unrest at Linsen E. Rd. Sec 8 has been confirmed as harassment by KMT affiliates. We reiterate: if you see suspicious people or a situation please let the security group know, and we will send someone&nbsp; to confirm.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>04:00 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [student from Kaohsiung Univ.] Our professor led us to here with two buses. And we students come here with another two. When we stand together at the congress, we have no sleep for the whole night. It was raining, and we were very tired. On the bus we kept thinking: although the situation is not as bad as the white terror (Rmk: about 1949~1987 in Taiwan), but we are still very worried. Also the voice of ambulances have been always around. It&rsquo;s really scary.</p><p></p><p>03:59 (Jinan Rd.) announcer: Do not let yourself be baited, avoid confrontations.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:59 (Jinan Rd.) Salary worker: I&rsquo;ve been coming here every evening since Tuesday night. If our president is so humble and well-mannered, why would our students become so unruly? Isn&rsquo;t there a problem here? I&rsquo;m going to encourage people to come here, and I urge everyone to do the same.</p><p></p><p>03:58 (Lin-Sen S. Rd Lane 8) announcer: There is a report of fireworks going off on the western side of the Congress building, there may be problems there.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:56 (Ching Tao E. Rd.) [Prof. from Kaohsiung Univ.] Who many laborer are still having minimum wage? If they are here today, they are the white collar class.</p><p></p><p>03:55 (Lin-Sen S. Rd Lane 8) Everything here is fine. It has been peaceful and has been no confrontation.</p><p></p><p>03:54 (Jinan Rd.) [student from Taiwan Normal Univ.] For a long time I&rsquo;ve been indifferent about street citizen movement. But in these two days I read a lot about CSSTA and then i decide to come here. My parents say &quot;everybody should do whatever their duties are.&quot; So, are the congressmen fulfilling their duties?</p><p></p><p>03:53 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Prof. from Kaohsiung University: Today none of us here want to come out again 24 years later or some other day. We are here today for our country, we do not want our youths to have no jobs or continue to earn the meager NT$22k/month.</p><p></p><p>03:52 (Jinan Rd.) [announcer] The power of citizens really make a difference. Not all current laws are appropriate, just like the Assembly and Parade Act just interpreted.</p><p></p><p>03:50 (Jinan Rd.) [Mr. Kao, student from Chinese Culture Univ.] Police Officers have their own things to protect. They have received policeman education, brainwashed. But they also have their right to disobey the orders they are given.</p><p></p><p>03:49 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Prof. from Kaohsiung University: I attended the Wild Lily Student Movement, 24 years ago. I don&rsquo;t understand why 24 years later I have to come back out. 24 years ago as a student I could not stand by and watch. Now I&rsquo;m no longer a student but I still could not stand by and watch. 24 years ago our government listened to us peacefully, with no police suppression, it was a peaceful protest. 24 years later we are supposed to be fully democratic and open, and yet the police is on us. What has the government been doing the last 24 years?</p><p></p><p>03:47 (Jinan Rd.) [student from Chinese Culture Univ.] This is the third time I come here from my home. I come here, because I am an independent citizen. We have the ability to decide what will happen to our country. We should tell the legislators (congressmen) that they did something wrong.</p><p></p><p>03:46 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Prof. from Kaohsiung University: I took a 4-hour bus ride to come up here. It&rsquo;s cold and no one wants to be here, but we are all here, are we here for ourselves? We are here for this country, this land. I have brought more than 60 students from Kaohsiung University and and students from Kaoshiung Medical School and Chungshan University. We fear no cold and no distance, and we just want to do the right thing.</p><p></p><p>03:45 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [announcer] Professor and students from Kaohsiung University are here to support us, and the professor would like to say a few words.</p><p></p><p>03:44 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [student from ChengYuan senior high] The Agreement is ambiguous. One (Chinese personnel) only needs a certification to come to Taiwan? Or they can just call come? The government should be more careful about this. They should be more responsible to the society, and deal with the issue better.</p><p></p><p>03:44 (Jinan Rd.) [student from Ming-Chuan Univ.] We are supposed to have classes in the daytime and (part-time) jobs in the evening. However, the director of my department and my boss support me to come here. My director said: &quot;There are now people lockpicked our door, eat what we put in our frig., and tell us &quot;you can have nothing.&quot; We can never accept this.</p><p></p><p>03:44(Ching-Tao g0v) [Announcer] We now have a professor from Nat&rsquo;l Kaohsiung Univ. brought his (her?) students here. Everyone please give them some applause.(applause)</p><p></p><p>03:42(Ching-Tao g0v) [Cheng Yuan Students]: I believe the only way for STA to pass is to do a clause-to-clause review. This trade agreement will sacrifice certain industries, the government should review this carefully.</p><p></p><p>03:41 (Ching-Tao East Rd.) [Announcer]: We&rsquo;ve received the latest information that there are individuals who are mixing with the crowds to encourage conflicts with the police. Please remember, if the police won&rsquo;t move, nor would we. If you spotted someone trying to cause trouble, please contact the us or the police immediately.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:40(Ching-Tao East Rd.) [Participant] What if our children ask us about the Service and Trade Agreement? What will be your response? Have we really did our best? We did it for Taiwan! For a much better future.</p><p></p><p>03:32 (Jinan Rd.) Native Taiwanese singer from the provincial Highway No.9 has come from Hualien to show his support: We are Taiwanese, not Chinese. I am a native Taiwanese, not an ethic minority from China.</p><p></p><p>03:31 (Meeting Hall) [broadcaster] Please search Youtube for the situation outside the Congressional building.</p><p></p><p>03:30 (Jinan Rd.) We have just received the result of Constitutional Interpretation of Justice of the Constitutional Court. Assembly and Parade Act is unconstitutional.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:29 (Meeting Hall) [voiceover] Friends from internet tell us ...(missing) our members there have called the police ...(missing). To our friends at the Linsen S. Rd.: please calm down, don&rsquo;t answer to their taunting.</p><p></p><p>03:26 (Meeting Hall) [voiceover] To friends outside Congress: please calm down, don&rsquo;t be encouraged by them.</p><p></p><p>03:24 (Jinan) [students from Nat&rsquo;l Taiwan Ocean Univ. speaking] We don&rsquo;t want the STA. We don&rsquo;t want Taiwan to be the next Tibet or Xinjiang.</p><p></p><p>03:23 (Meeting Hall) [broadcast] (interrupted)... we have reported to the police. Everyone Please stay where you are...(interrupted) we are trying to deal with the situation...&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:22 (Alley 8, Linseng S. Rd.) Currently at Linseng S. Rd., around 10 individuals have come in an attempt to inflame the gathered protesters.</p><p></p><p>03:19 (Jinan Rd.) (connection resumed) [Student from Chung-Cheng Univ. speaking] There has been people in the congress, harming its true owner (i.e. all citizens). So we should re-occupy the congress, and turn in into the right order.</p><p></p><p>03:18 (Meeting Hall) [broadcast] We are currently figuring out the situation (details missing) is from the KMT Youth League. We have team members dealing with this.</p><p></p><p>03:14 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [announcer] We are now making banners to write our opinions against the STA. We are asking you to provide the relevant tools. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>03:14 (8th Lane, Linsen S. Rd.) Please do not call the live stream broadcaster Mr. TS by the 0987 number, it will interrupt the live stream.If you need to contact him, please call the 0977 number.</p><p></p><p>03:09 (8th Lane, Linsen S. Rd.) Current situation: People are discussing the police shift change issue. There are people who don&rsquo;t want to let the police change shifts, while the security team believes the police needs to change shifts.</p><p></p><p>03:05 (Meeting Hall) [broadcast] We have seen your messages, thank you all for your concerns.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:04 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [announcer] We ask students on site not to climb into the Meeting Hall through the windows. This will only increase the tension between us and the police. So please relax and keep calm.</p><p></p><p>03:01 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [speech] Hello everybody, I am Paul from the US. I love Taiwan, so I give up a salary of 3.5 million NTD (Rmk: about 120 thousands USD) an year and come to Taiwan. I believe in Taiwan and I believe in hope of Taiwan. Do you know what my mom told me the day before I came back? She said I must be crazy! I come back, and donate as much as possible. Because I believe every person can make it different. I now find the decision I made 4 years ago were right. Because not only that I love Taiwan, but also all of you do, don&rsquo;t we? I love you, Taiwan!</p><p></p><p>03:00 (Jinan Rd.) [announcer] We welcome independent musicians supporting us with sound equipment to the stage. [Dan] Hello all, I have my own band, but that&rsquo;s not related to today&rsquo;s event so I won&rsquo;t say more about it. First, lets thank the volunteer sound engineers here, they&rsquo;re from The Wall and Legacy. Let us give them a round of applause! (applause) (signal interrupted)</p><p></p><p>02:55 (Jinan Rd.) [Students from Taiwan Sports Univ. giving a speech] I come and join everybody today, because I don&rsquo;t want to wake up tomorrow and find that something happens to Taiwan. I am proud of myself for standing here, and I believe the same for you. Also I want to thank the police officers: you have been working hard. For all friends here: the longer we insist, the more powerful we are. Let&rsquo;s cheer up!</p><p></p><p>02:54 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [announcer] The security team please go to Sun Yat-Sen S. Rd. to help the newcoming students to sit here. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>02:53 (Meeting Hall) [broadcast] Attention please! we have three news from our sources. It&rsquo;s likely that during 3 to 5 am there will be an attack. So please refrain from coming in and out. Please continue to rest if you are resting. Also, for the security team, please always keep half of you awake and half of you resting. Thanks!</p><p></p><p>02:52 (Ching-Tao - g0v) Good news to us! People in the two buses from Sun Yat-Sen Univ, in Kaohsiung have arrived and joined us.</p><p></p><p>02:50 (Jinan Rd.) People are sharing their experience about the five assaults of the police in the first night.</p><p></p><p>02:48 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [Freddy] Amnesty International has asked Taiwanese authorities to show restraint when deploying the police. This message has been broadcasted in English, French and other languages.</p><p></p><p>02:48 (Jinan Rd.) [Students from Jiufen] Here is one thing I want to do: I want to thank all of you! Thank you for not giving up, so that we can turn this island in danger into a beautiful land. We&rsquo;ll do it!</p><p></p><p>02:45 (Jinan Rd.) [Host] Now we still have a lot of trash around here. Please help to maintain the cleanliness. On the other hand, we are looking for volunteer to join us from 3 am to 6 am to maintain the cleanness of the site together. Of course, it&rsquo;ll just be even better if you can stay after 6 am.</p><p></p><p>02:40 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [Freddy] We don&rsquo;t want this kind of unfair competition.</p><p></p><p>02:39 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [Freddy] So we&rsquo;re not afraid of the competition. But we don&rsquo;t want a competition that is about who is getting along better with the communist party in China, who is getting along better with Lien Shen-wen.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:38 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [Freddy] What we are afraid of is the rich getting even richer. Trade agreements around the world are all like that, those in bed with international conglomerates get richer first.</p><p></p><p>02:36 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [Freddy] We have been here for three days. How can we be afraid of competitions? We cannot.</p><p></p><p>02:35 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [Freddy] I want to tell you something. At the moment on the internet there are people saying we are against the Agreement (STA) because we don&rsquo;t want to compete.</p><p></p><p>02:34 (Ching-Tao - g0v) (Freddy and Doris coming to the site)</p><p></p><p>02:34 (Ching-Tao - g0v) [an elementary school teacher] We should think this way: Everyone of us is very important in the movement here.</p><p></p><p>02:32 (Jinan Rd.)

[student (abstract)] Our group includes not only students from Chung Cheng University but also Pingtung Uni. of Science and Technology, and Chiayi University. It&rsquo;s a little chaotic here and we&rsquo;re a bit unsettled, but we&rsquo;ll do our best to stay here, because as long as we can remain here our fellows can remain inside. I know that Internet access and cell phone reception in the area are both poor, but I ask that people keep contacting their parents, family members, and friends, and tell them that we have occupied this place!</p><p></p><p>02:17 (Meeting Hall) [broadcast] Beside Dr. Sun Yat-Sen that is Ma Ying-Jeou ...

Right now we have been occupied the legislature Yuan( Congress) for about 53 hours. It&rsquo;s 2:00Am in the morning at Jinan Rd. stage. We got some information that Head of the legislature Yuan - Jing-Ping Wang will be hosting a meeting with Ministers in the 3/21/14 at morning. We hope they can give us an answer before noon. In the mean time we will convoke the press conference at Ching-Tao E. Rd.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:09 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [student from Nat&rsquo;l Taiwan Univ.] Are we mobs!?

We hope all people here, if you&rsquo;re too tired, don&rsquo;t over-exhaust yourself, because this could be a long battle. We see that some pro-China medias are trying to defame us, people may find this unbelievable but I have to said: it&rsquo;s okay because we don&rsquo;t have time to care.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:04 (Ching-Tao E.

We see that Wang Jyn-Pyng said that we are causing damage to the items in the congress. Does that make sense? Also, my teachers asked me what we are doing here. We are here to protect our democracy, not here to have fun or something! We&rsquo;re here to defend the democracy, isn&rsquo;t it? Thank you!</p><p></p><p>01:58 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [Prof. Lee] We are showing to the Europeans: we are working on the democracy of Taiwan.</p><p></p><p>01:58 (Ching-Tao site northeast) [director] Just like what Mr. Huang said, we are thankful for the police officers here, just like we&rsquo;re not against Chinese people. We appreciate the effort of the police officers, thanks.</p><p></p><p>01:56 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.)

[director] Now we introduce Suming (Remark: A Taiwanese songwriter and musician)</p><p></p><p>01:24 (Jinan Rd.) [speech] The reason that the government can do some ridiculous things is exactly because we citizens are indifferent. Now you hear what people say here, and you should think and decide if you agree or believe. And if you do, we ask for your action to help us citizen groups.</p><p></p><p>01:21 (Meeting Hall) The broadcaster is taking a nap.

Rd.) Citizens from Yunghe (in New Taipei City) sharing their ideas.</p><p></p><p>01:07 (Jinan Rd.) [speech] This morning, we present our demands. And the answer we get from Premier Jiang Yi-Huah is that &quot;Please protect the democracy and don&rsquo;t occupy the congress.&quot; But who is harming the democracy? Today, who have learned much here from many professors about pros and cons for the Service and Trade Agreement (STA). And here, I ask you, to keep thinking more about the issue, and continue to supervise what the government is doing. After all, the STA is just one of the many issues around us. Our government right now only cares about GDP, and doesn&rsquo;t share with people on the information regarding their decisions. Many policies that could harm the citizens, such as the Eminent domain (compulsory purchase) in Taoyuan, are just made secretly. We believe that NGO and other citizen groups are important to Taiwan democracy - we need them to put their eyes on the decision of the government, so that the government can hear our voice. (omitted a sentence about UK)</p><p></p><p>01:02 (Jinan Rd.) [director] The NTU hospital is around, and we don&rsquo;t want to produce noise to the patients. So please keep your volume down. Also, people have been saying on the internet that the police is planning an assault. Are we going to let them succeed? [Audience] No! [director] Let&rsquo;s be confident. As long as we are here, our friends inside (Legislative Yuan) will be fine. Don&rsquo;t be too worried.</p><p></p><p>00:51 (Meeting Hall) [broadcast] We&rsquo;ll open the restroom once every 30 minutes. All of us are very tired, and there is no entrance here available. Also, the live video is on YouTube right now. It&rsquo;s raining outside at the moment, so please remember to bring some rain gears if you want to come and help.</p><p></p><p>00:51 (Meeting Hall) [director] Attention please! Later from 1:30 am we&rsquo;ll have to restrict the use of restroom - please use it now if needed. Later we might open it once every 30 minutes.</p><p></p><p>00:49 (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Hsu Se-jie of Academia Sinica is giving a talk titled &quot;There is an elephant in the room.&quot;</p><p></p><p>00:47 (Jinan Rd.) [director] New supporters have joined us, let us welcome the students from National Chung Cheng University! (slogans shouted) We now have more than 10,000 people at Jinan Rd. and Chingdao E. Rd. is also very crowded, with 25,000 people in attendance! Friends at Jinan Rd. please note that as we have many friends coming up from the south, and to conserve energy, activities on the Jinan Rd. stage will end at 3am. People who would like to continue to listen to talks and entertainment should go to the Chingdao E. Rd. stage so that people can rest at the Jinan Rd. location.</p><p></p><p>00:46 (Meeting Hall) If people want to send materials to us please contact the logistics team.</p><p></p><p>00:44 (Meeting Hall) [director] The logistics group at the 7-11 on the intersection of Chingdao E.

Please preserve your energy, so that we can fight till the last minute. Last song is &quot;One Shooting Start&quot;</p><p></p><p>00:39 (Meeting Hall) The propane bottle issue we mentioned earlier has been resolved. Everyone please stop worrying and we can start our resting period.</p><p></p><p>00:36 (Meeting Hall) [Director] Be quiet, guys. We just found out that there&rsquo;s a box of propane shipped in here from the second floor. Of course we didn&rsquo;t ask this to be delivered. Please pay attention as there might be dangerous items being shipped here. Please take care of your safety. From now on, the security team on the second floor will start checking items that have been delivered here. And we ask everyone to check closely to everything being delivered inside. Be cautious so that we can say that we are not bringing any dangerous item, and are not asking anyone to bring those. Please be cooperative to the item control. Now you can all rest. Thank you guys.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>00:33 (Jinan Rd) [Finn] Next song is &quot;Floating Island&quot;. I wrote it when i attended the &quot;Don&rsquo;t bid farewell to the East Coastline&quot; I hope we can start reflecting about things happening around us through the song.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>00:30 (Chingdao E. Rd.) We do not want anyone to get hurt, we don&rsquo;t want the police to get hurt either. &quot;We will not move if the police does not move;&quot; &quot;We will only move if the police moves.&quot;</p><p></p><p>00:28 (Chingdao E.

Please give them a hand.</p><p></p><p>00:21 (Jinan Rd) [director] A few friends from the Feng Chia University Music Club have come to the site, and I would like them to say a few words to us. [Feng Chia student] (extract) The reason why we came here is simple. My friends said that it is silly to come here, but I still chose to do so. I do not want to have any regret after ten years. I have read quite many articles on CSTA, and I would like to say, &quot; I am against black box operation, I am also against CSTA!&quot; &quot;Keep up the good work everyone!&quot;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>00:20 (Jinan Rd) So far, we have occupied the Legislative Yuan for over 41 hours. We are grateful for the lawyer team here. So if get dispersed by the police later, we have lawyers to help.</p><p></p><p>00:13 (Meeting Hall) speaker: I am Jeng-jeng (lit. &quot;really&quot;), as in &quot;really really interesting&quot; (laughs) I am a volunteer with the Earth Citizen group, and I came up from Kaohsiung yesterday early in the morning. People inside are tired, and people outside only more so. (leads in singing &quot;Goodnight&quot;).</p><p></p><p>00:12&nbsp; (Jinan Rd) The perfomance&rsquo;s still going on. (artist: Miss Silksock, singing Galaxy Express)</p><p></p><p>00:05 (Meeting Hall) [director] Taipei City Fire Department leader Huang told us they could not supply ambulances or stretchers, despite our repeated entreaties to him regarding the situation here. He refused to respond to hypotheticals, and said that since this movement was started by us we must be responsible for the consequences. It is cold outside and protesters outside are under threat of hypothermia and other health emergencies. We decry the Fire Department&rsquo;s attitude and hold them responsible for possible health emergencies among attendees.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>March 20, 2014</b></p><p></p><p>23:59 (Meeting Hall) [director] We are keeping around 4-500 people inside.

Rd., please be careful. Right now we need about 20 folding chairs, compatible walkie-talkies, one mobile IP router, and some&nbsp; art supplies. We have more than 100 boxes of water and more than enough food, please don&rsquo;t send any more food and water right now, thank you!</p><p></p><p>23:52 (Jinan Rd.) &quot;Miss Silk Stocking&quot; performs on stage: we will not leave despite the rain, we must let them see Taiwanese perseverance.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>23:48 (Jinan Rd.)

If anyone could provide an IP router please sent it to the logistics team on Chingdao E. Rd., thank you!

Please go to the NTU Hospital, MRT NTU Hospital Station, or MRT Shandao Temple Station if you need a bathroom.

We only put the total number of occupying hours on there. If you have paint or other art supplies please send them to the logistics team, thank you. Someone asked earlier if we still needed flashlights, we don&rsquo;t need them right now, thanks again!</p><p></p><p>23:31 (Legislation Yuan Meeting Hall) Director: It&rsquo;s now 23:31.

Please donate NT$10, NT$100, whatever you can; &quot;Baby Bear&quot; band is performing right now.</p><p></p><p>23:27 (Ching-Dao E. Rd.) Prof. Hsu Wei-Jhe （許維哲教授）: I believe the CSTA has to cater the opposing emotion between the countries. I don&rsquo;t think anyone would like to see Taiwan becoming a part of PRC as the consequence of passing the CSTA. Therefore, it is a part to be considered carefully when signing the CSTA. Apart from that, I&rsquo;d like to share a thought from a singer from Hong Kong - I like Taiwan because of its special social bonds. It&rsquo;s also the same reason why I treasure Taiwan as a whole. I&rsquo;ve prepared a song for you guys.</p><p></p><p>23:24: (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Chou Wan-Yao (周婉窈教授) of National Taiwan University （國立臺灣大學）: ... This is similar to the black box operation when passing the CSTA for vote - Announcing without noticing in advance and forcing everybody to accept. The government wouldn&rsquo;t face the crowd even the people are questioning her rationally.</p><p></p><p>2320: (Ching-Dao E. Rd.) Prof. Hsu Wei-Jhe （許維哲教授）: Who is benefited from the current social structure and system? This question is also applicable to the CSTA - who will be benefited from the treaty? This is the question we need to think about... There are more than 3 million blue collar workers, 2 million white collar workers and 2 million skilled workers in this country, but only 1.2% of the working class populations is managers. These 1.2% of people are in the vested-interest class.</p><p></p><p>23:20 (Legislation Yuan Meeting Hall) Director: Material group still needs 20 seats and a walkie-talkie transmission system. Please help spread the news.</p><p></p><p>23:15 (Ching-Dao E. Rd.) Prof. Hsu Wei-Jhe （許維哲教授）: This is a shallow interpretation of the CSTA. CSTA is not just a economic matter... Let me break this down - Economic will always be related to politics, and this can be seen in the treaty. Many scholars pointed out that the strategy taken by the PRC is &rsquo;Economy first, and then Politics&rsquo;. I believe President Ma also acknowledges the strong political force behind CSTA. I don&rsquo;t understand if we can/can&rsquo;t treat the treaty as a plain economic issue... (Interference kicked in)</p><p></p><p>23:06 (Jinan Rd.) Director: There&rsquo;re over 20000 people protesting at Ching-Dao E. Rd. now.</p><p></p><p>23:00 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) Director: The meeting hall is now entry-only. Re-arrangement of manpower inside the hall is now under way. Please enter via. Entrance No.8. Assistance is available there.</p><p></p><p>22:58 (Ching-Dao E. Rd.) Mr. Lai: I joined the Kuomintang （國民黨）about 6 months ago. However, I can&rsquo;t see the future I would like to see there. Soon after, I quitted the job with 4 of my classmates. Because I realized that to have a better future... The representatives of the citizens all have the mind of their own. There&rsquo;re a lot of students and working class members standing out today here, this is all because we care, because of the unfair procedure, the unfair treaty. We don&rsquo;t know if these actions would ever work or not, but here, today, Taiwan should no longer be divided by parties, but arriving in a consensus... Because we believe in Taiwan, we know that we can change this society. We need to the entire society know - RETREAT THE TRADE PACT, DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY.</p><p></p><p>22:54 (Ching-Dao E. Rd.) Director: We are now asking for donations of cameras. Coming up is a speech delivered by National Taiwan University （國立臺灣大學）Civil Engineering Student Mr. Lai.</p><p></p><p>22:54 (Jinan Rd.)

The director there is now introducing the 2nd lawyer group. Koo Li-Siong (顧立雄) has arrived.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>22:09 (Jinan Rd.) Lawyer: I was in the charging crowds on the first day, and I came here in the next night, and the size of crowds had almost doubled. Today&rsquo;s crowd is even bigger - 4-5 times bigger than yesterday, and this moves me deeply.</p><p></p><p>22:06 (Outside Legislative Yuan) Latest news confirmed that the government will attempt to clear the protesters away today, and they are discussing who is going to make that order.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>21:56 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) The live broadcast of inside the meeting hall on ustream has now been terminated (recovered by 22:07).

Rd.) Live broadcast disconnected.</p><p></p><p>21:52 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) Director: The statement made by the Office of the President stated that a inter-yuan meeting will be held to sort the issue out, however this doesn&rsquo;t fit our expectation - we demand a direct dialogue between the citizens and the president.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>21:51 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Speaker: Ladies and gentlemen, the one who have the power has decided to sacrifice the interest of many enterprises for the interest of few. To put this in perspective - What we are seeing is violence. What the Legislative Yuan has done a few days ago is an action of disrespecting and devastating of democracy. In addition to that, Taiwanese police is now becoming a tool of institutional violence, but that&rsquo;s not the case in the last few days - they have been protecting us with their best effort. Please give them a round of applause, showing our gratefulness towards their action.</p><p></p><p>21:46 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Speaker: I asked my students a few days back in a lesson, &rsquo;Why you are still sitting here!&rsquo;, and now we are all here. The citizens of Taiwan has now occupied the Legislative Yuan, disallowing any meetings from happening. RETREAT THE TRADING PACT! DEFEND OUR LIBERTY! STAND TILL THE LAST! Don&rsquo;t forget - This is our common promise!</p><p></p><p>21:45 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Director: People outside, let&rsquo;s pay our respect to the protesters in the Legislative Yuan, shall we? Please remember this - We are now standing together upon this situation.</p><p></p><p>21:43 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) Director: Now announcing the statement from the office of the President.</p><p></p><p>21:41 (Jinan Rd.) Director: We also have supply tents on the other side, people who is standing nearby the supply tents, please pass the rain coat to the middle of the crowd, and don&rsquo;t forget to re-use it, thank you.</p><p></p><p>21:37 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) Director: [Part of the statement]: We are now attempting to find a solution to this issue in any way we can.

If anyone needs any materials please head for the counter, and stop using your personal materials (including LINE messenger) because this will make things very, very complicated.</p><p></p><p>21:33 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) Reject the Pact! Protect the democracy!</p><p></p><p>21:20 (Jinan Rd.) Lawyer: The lawyer group is now here ready at your service. We currently have 80 strong, and 120 standing by. We will help defending your brave acts. However we&rsquo;d like to remind you, when the unfortunate eventuality has happened, which you have been taken to the police station, please tell the police that I need a lawyer. My phone number is 25231178. Please use your right of silence and remain quiet. If you are forced to speak, please tell them that you are excising your civil rights. If you are thirsty, just remember that the police has the responsibility to give you the water. Only make your statements when you are accompanied by a lawyer. It is illegal for the police to handcuff and interrogate you. We will stand by your side until the end. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>21:20 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) I am an environmental lawyer, before I was concerned with cases like the Guo-Guang Petrochemical case(國光石化). In the last few days when I saw you enter the Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall, only then did I realize that the Cross Straits Services Agreement has everything to do with environmental safety evaluation. Road and bridge construction and the telecommunications system are all going to be opened up under this Cross Straits Services Agreement. Before we begin to open up, we must first asses all the risks that we are going to be facing, don&rsquo;t we? And only then we will know if this development is something that we can accept or not and how we should face it. But now we have no idea what kind of impact the big Chinese enterprises are going to have on our environment and on people with less employability. All this we have not yet assessed.</p><p>I want to share something else with everybody, I am a full-time lawyer for the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (the crowd is cheering). That we can have rights like this, this was all fought out by the older generations. Thirty years ago in Taiwan, we lawyers couldn&rsquo;t imagine that can now stand up and speak up like this. Back then this was a dream too far to reach. But because Zhen Nan-Rong(鄭南榕) lit a light for us in the darkness, standing up for our rights is now the natural thing to do. This is the time we live in, no matter how good or bad, this is still our time. We must protect our home-country. Everybody stay strong!</p><p></p><p>21:13 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) Lawyer: Your counsel fee has already been paid off when you stepped inside! You are not alone, the whole world is watching</p><p></p><p>21:13 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Student from Zhong Shan Girls&rsquo; High School (中山女中): We do want to go window shopping, but we must spend our time on the right place. Although we&rsquo;re just high school students, we might not understand STA thoroughly... (disconnected)... we learn from the history class, students in other country would step out. Shame on governors for such a&nbsp; backroom deals. Give our democracy back!</p><p></p><p>21:11 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Director: Today we have many scholars here to share us the problem of STA, we have more activity and talks in the following hours. Next, student from (Zhong Shan Girls&rsquo; High School (中山女中) would like to share her opinion.</p><p></p><p>20:51 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) Lawyer group: Thanks to everyone who step out for defending the democracy, you are not alone, we will be here as your backup, and the number of lawyers is still increasing</p><p></p><p>20:40 (Jinan Rd.) Yi-Mei Yang (楊伊湄): We are not mob. We are the people. We don&rsquo;t want to be the victim of libel. We don&rsquo;t need media with calumniated intention.</p><p></p><p>20:38 (Jinan Rd.)

Alley No.8 of&nbsp; Ching-Tao E. Rd. 2. the road to Alley No.8 of Ching-Tao E. Rd., from the&nbsp; Intersection of Ching-Tao E. Rd.and Zhenjiang St. (There is a path&nbsp; between the NGO building and the underground parking lot ramp)</p><p></p><p>19:36 (Ching-Tao E.

Rd.) too many people lining up to speak...we pause the registration for a while...please keep your belonging safe too...</p><p></p><p>19:35 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) I was wondering if it makes sense if I stand up. But does it make any sense to eat or to sleep? Just believe your faith, that makes things different. It makes sense if I can make people in the main hall persist for one min longer.</p><p></p><p>19:19 ((Ching-Tao E. Rd.) student from TKU. before the student occupied the Parliament, anyone of you understand the free trade with China? I think it is minor. So we have to thank them for attracting the public opinion.

I did not know anything about outside. Now I put off everything to join. I&rsquo;ve never been so angry. Even though I study so much, I can&rsquo;t really analyze the pros and cons of the free trade. I am not so professional. But we are in a democratic country, we have to do in the democratic way. whether the free trade is good nor not, I am disappoint that the ruling party does not obey the formal law making process. Hope the government do not be blind, just come out and accept our opinion.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>18:26 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.)&nbsp; Now we have so many people, the police won&rsquo;t move...because we are the real power of people.</p><p></p><p>18:24 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.)&nbsp; I read the content of ECFA. It&rsquo;s unfair. I am not against it. But do not do in the blackbox. we should make a documentary of President Ma. so no future politicians can learn the lesson.</p><p></p><p>18:18 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) I want to say...I am fucking so tired...but we are not afraid...we&rsquo;d rather be tired for days, not for life. Thank you .</p><p></p><p>18:16 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) This evening this is the open forum for students here. everyone can give a short speech. please register for the line-up.</p><p></p><p>18:15 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.)

Rd.) now the rain coats are distributing, the forum is starting.&nbsp; Welcome Mr. Yu (an elementary teacher). I risks my career to be here because I am a public school teacher. I heard people asking why the students here do not go to class, why they care the economics to much. Today, we stand here, do we stand out for any politician? No we stand here for the people. I majored economics in the university. Ask yourself, does our current government makes your life better? I like to say something to my student. I can&rsquo;t speak this in the school. but I am very proud to be here. We adult are shameful because we can&rsquo;t protect your future. Please protect the children&rsquo;s future.</p><p></p><p>17:34 (Jinan Rd.) Student from Shih Shin University: My life [before this event] was essentially a loser; I&rsquo;ve heard that 3G connection is spotty here, but perhaps you have seen this message about news stations covering this event: This is why we are against media&rsquo;s monopoly on news -- during the Wild Lilies protest&nbsp; in 1990, the mainstream newsletter ChinaTimes had a lot more guts than media nowadays; they accepted a donation box nearby their new station, taking small donations (NTD$100 or $1000) to put a half-page advertisement on their newspaper to show that they sympathize with the Wild Lilies student protestors. But are today&rsquo;s media doing the same? Are they feeling the weight of the current event? When they are all muted by censorship, would the journalists here think twice about your professionalism, and how partisan politics have strangled your freedom of press? However, all of us are all reporters here, because we can use our own Facebook accounts, our own phones, to let the world know that is happening today. Who is the mainstream, and who is the fringe? When the news anchors are covering the &quot;My Love from the Star&quot; TV series, and we are covering the Dapu [eminent domain dispute] Incident, the TISA agreement -- who exactly is the fringe media here? Everybody, please carry on. Rock on. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>17:20 (Jinan Rd.) Pastor: As a pastor, my vocation and duties are: Intercession [praying for other people], blessing, and to protect others. For example, I take the bus each morning, and talk to high school students crowded on the same bus. I&rsquo;m very impressed, really, that the students are willing to get up early and strive. If students are not willing to stand out, Taiwan would have no hope at all. I remember when I was young, during the Ilha Formosa Incident, which I&rsquo;ve participated. The TISA incident of late seemed like a reenactment of that. We often prayed for the Taiwan government, which is very tiring, because we don&rsquo;t see such universal values such as democracy and mutual respect.&nbsp; The State puts restriction on you, but you are still willing to come out, so please continue to hold this faith, this willingness to contribute. Perhaps our generation did not contribute enough, so you&rsquo;d still need to continue this work. Were you not willing to come out, we wouldn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to sit here today. I won&rsquo;t use provocative words here, but I will pray for everyone with my own way: Father God, we thank you for giving us the beautiful island of Taiwan, which is where our ancestors lived, and we are willing to guard the place, thank you so we are willing to come out; whether we are in the field of congress, or sitting here in the harsh weather, we are here for the people. Lord, grant us the spirit of wisdom, strength and courage. I beg you also help the President Ma, please remove his ignorance and incompetence. Please have mercy on Taiwan and bless our young people. Rise them so they know what is charity, freedom, equality, and grant them physical and mental health, I pray thee, keep them, so they can be free from fears and worries, looking up to God in their pursuit of truth. Thank the Lord, thank you.</p><p></p><ul class="comment"><li>Missing: 15:32 ~ 17:17 from <a href="https://ethercalc.org/static/proxy/hackpad/"></a>https://ethercalc.org/static/proxy/hackpad/ - volunteers wanted:&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>15:37 (Jinan Rd.) Fan, Gan-hua (范綱華): ...door entrance is only under an awning, consistently sits a few elderly people. That day my heart had a strong feeling of helplessness. Because I have a 2 year old child, I have to go home. But when I was at home and saw 200 students rush into parliament, I felt my morale was boosted. The next day, I came to here, and found that students were rational and respectful. They were enthusiastic, but did not loose rationality. I want to cheer on the participants. I cannot provide a correct economic analysis of the trade agreement. Recently, I have been considering what is a person&rsquo;s happiness. Besides eating until full and having enough to wear to stay warm, the most important thing is having a sense of control in life. Meaning we need to be sure our goal is achievable. What sociologists strive to achieve is to find a way so each person can feel happy. But our efforts from these years, has been stripped due to this issue. Do not even mention when the trade agreement begins, it is possible that not matter how hard we try, we will have no way of feeling happy. Even though we are all seeking a little happiness, riding a bike or drinking a cup of coffee, but this is also a type of helplessness, because there is no larger happiness to pursue. Even more tragic is that in the future, it is possible that even this type of small happiness will all dissapear. We are here today, we should allow those who are not concerned, let them know that our happiness may be deprived.Fan, Gan-hua (范綱華): ...door entrance is only under an awning, consistently sits a few elderly people.

Please keep the sit-in area for those who are participating in the sit-in. There are many people outside who would like to enter, but they cannot. For those who are on scene, please value the time you are here.</p><p></p><p>15:24 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) The broadcast has ended.</p><p></p><p>15:32 (Meeting Hall) Hello everyone, I am OOO (sorry, it&rsquo;s not clear), I am from the National Yang Min University (陽明大學) sign language club.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is really nice that everyone can come together to discuss the trade agreement. I would like to tell everyone a small story about Beitou (北投). Everyone knows that we have many development cases, and Taipei will also want to keep build gondalas. Just building the Maokong Gondala had many problems. But a lot of people may not know, the Taipei City government is planning on building a second gondala system in Beitou, the Beitou Gondala.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is actually a very big controversy. If you have visited Beitou, you will know, Beitou is a place with hot springs, with a lot of sulfur. Actually the residents of Beitou probably change their electronics every three to four years because those metals contain... (not clear). Also, Beitou has many things from the Japanese era. That area has many old homes and old trees. Beitou Park, which is the park at the Xinbeitou Metro station, is 101 years old this year. The park is filled with stories. But but the government nevertheless decided to build there. The residents of Beitou are very against it. They have been actively vocal, but the statements I made before, keep being suppressed. Much like all development cases. Actually this case is still active, so if everyone would like to understand more or would like to provide some power, you can look up &quot;青年不北纜&quot; on Facebook. This is the situation surrounding the Beitou Gondala.</p><p></p><p>15:26 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) We are absolutely not battling GDP, what we are battling is to be able to live well on this island with limited resources. If we continue to develop, we will not have clean air or water. But in our government&rsquo;s growth, the government does not even discuss this type of issue. We do not want to stay in the myth of (be lost in) GMP and GDP. (Note: GMP is the Good Manufacturing Process, a certification of food safety; however there have been recent cases of products with the GMP seal not containing the ingredients labeled, leading to public scrutiny of food safety in Taiwan)</p><p></p><p>15:22 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) The trade agreement also opens many public service industries. The public resources that we cherish and share, such as tap water, airport services, even natural resources - things that cannot be combined with economics - can also be handed over in the trade agreement.</p><p></p><p>15:53 (Meeting Hall) At the moment the internet signal is going on and off, it is not stable.</p><p></p><p>15:30 (Jinan Rd.) As long as we have freedom, then we can establish a homeland. This our current Taiwan! If we do not protect this land, we would disappoint our ancestors! That is why we need to persist, to let Ma Ying-jeou and that group of people know that the power of the people is not easily despised. At Ching-Tao E. Rd., I heard many people share their thoughts. It turns out, many parents and doctors do not know what the trading agreement is. Some people thought it was a gas station, others thought it was a cold syrup. Then Taiwan would be sold. But I do not believe we will be confused our whole lives. Since we already understand, we have the responsibility to wake up our brothers in arms, our family and friends. I am not against being friends with China. Taiwan enjoys forming friendships. But I am against being sold out! This parliament has betrayed 30 years of democracy, and by destroying judicial procedures, have destroyed the meaning of justice. Beloved friends, I do not have the qualifications to teach class. I have already spoken too long. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>15:28 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [director] The trading agreement has opened many of the public service industry, and those are our precious public property such as water, airport, and even nature enviromnet.</p><p></p><p>15:15 (Meeting Hall) Idea sharing by student from National Taiwan University.</p><p></p><p>15:15 (Meeting Hall) Idea sharing by student from Law School Sophomore, Soochow University.</p><p></p><p>15:14 (Meeting Hall) [director] There are two student wish to share. We hope to have more of us to stand out and share their idea. (Lost of internet connection)</p><p></p><p>15:13 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [director] let&rsquo;s evaluate this trading agreement and the current economy in Taiwan. We wish to have a better economical analysis. The statement from our government suggest people to join the trading agreement; otherwise, we may loss our competitiveness and further causing serious issue in Taiwan. We must ask the following questions. What has our government done for us? Why should we rely ourselves on the country which desperate to annex us. Tiding us to them, do you believe it is right? (No we don&rsquo;t). Is it really good for Taiwan to use this analogy and to have this cooperation with the other market? What have we seen? Therefore, it is the best to have a smaller government, and everything should be released to people. e.g. Water Department could be run by civilian cooperation. Also, we were all mad on ETC or the difficulty on running Taiwan High Speed Rail. The benefit of releasing those utility to private cooperation is the growth on GDP. But, those are just his hypothesis. Was not ECFA suppose to be the solution given by the government? (Lost of internet connection)</p><p></p><p>15:10 (Meeting Hall) [director] Is there any students from the National Tung Hua University? Here is a letter from the principal of the National Tung Hua University. (Sorry for the bad Internet connection)</p><p></p><p>15:01 (Meeting Hall) [director] Everyone, we have a very good news today. Our news is reported by a newspaper at Sri Lanka. Our effort and the value that we are defending is delivered to all of the world. Please give yourselves a round of applause! (applause) Is there any students from the National Chung Cheng University? No? That&rsquo;s fine, because there are six buses coming from there.</p><p></p><p>14:58 (Meeting Hall) [speaker] This is a hard road we&rsquo;re on. I&rsquo;ve been following all of you for the last 3 days on Facebook, and so decided to come up from Chiayi. I am worried for your welfare and what you might do in the future. My fellow students, you are now exemplars to all, and some people have been examining your every move under a microscope; please be careful, okay? (Yes!) Also, we can not stay here forever, one day we will leave. Please understand the position of our police force, they are also under tremendous pressure. Let&rsquo;s be considerate of them together, okay? (Yes!)&nbsp; I also hope that all of you will stand up and move around a bit, because the Hall is really stuffy. Please feel free to tell me of anything you need, I will try to coordinate with the police. The most important thing is that I hope all of you will stay safe and be careful of your conduct, thank you.</p><p></p><p>14:45 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) The host introduces every university of which has participated.</p><p></p><p>14:43 (Meeting Hall) [director] Yesterday when the webcast was interrupted were we all nervous? When we couldn&rsquo;t get our message out someone passed a note in, and it said, &quot;Only a wall divides us, our hearts are together!&quot; I know that CNN began to report our actions only because many of our fellow students here have been compiling information and sending them out. We now have protesters from more than 50 schools around the country participating here, let&rsquo;s give them our applause! We are unable to list all schools here, we&rsquo;ll compile a list later this evening, and we apologize for that. I also know that we are a multi-talented group, some of us can sing and play guitar, some are in performance groups or can do comedy crosstalk, right now we don&rsquo;t have air conditioning and the Hall is stuffy; if you possess a talent please go see the bald handsome dude in the back.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>14:40 (Jinan Rd.) Taiwanese Premier Jiang Yi-huah responded to the CSSTA controversy with, &quot;Thank you for your opinions, please respect democracy.&quot; Can you accept this response? (No!) Who is really destroying our democracy?</p><p></p><p>14:30 (Jinan Rd.) As of now, there has more than 200 teachers volunteered for street lecture on the topic of &quot;Democratic Rights&quot;.</p><p></p><p>14:24 (Jinan Rd.) The democracy lecture on the street: Prof. Lin Guo-Ming from Department of Sociology, National Taiwan University &quot;The Pact, the right of resist and Deliberative Democracy&quot; &quot;What is deliberative democracy that is the policy need to have the space for discussion.&nbsp; When the government makes the policy, the government cannot force the people to accept everything by saying that we are the government or we are the relative large group.&nbsp; Politics is not a head count, a policy need to convince people by describing its influence and the subject that will be affected by this policy.&nbsp; The worry from the people should be released and the government has to make sure that different side of the opinion can be heard in the process of making the decision. Does the process of deliberative democracy happen in the process of negotiating the Pact?&quot;&nbsp; (No!)</p><p></p><p>14:24 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) The singing is leading by the students from National Yang Ming University</p><p></p><p>14:12 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [director] This protest will continue for a long time. We must hold on to our faith.</p><p></p><p>14:07 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [director] Friends, we have been working hard, are we tired? I am glad to see all of us still defending this place. After we have announced our ultimatum at the press conference, we have received a reply from President Ma Ying-jeou and Parliament Speaker Wang Jing-ping. I think our friends in the press here already know what that reply is, but I would like to make a report on it to the rest of us here anyway. Before today we have always known that Speaker Wang may exercise his police power inside the Legislature to remove us, but as he believes this demonstration is a matter for law and order, he has refrained from doing so. We have been here two days and neither President Ma nor Speaker Wang has given us a response. Therefore we announce that we will not leave this Meeting Hall before a formal response from the government is given, and if we have no response before Friday 12:30 pm, we will not rule out the possibility of further actions. We demand an answer from President Ma, that he should respond to the people. Thank you all for being here. Us friends inside and outside the Meeting Hall have been here for more than 40 hours, but President Ma and Speaker Wang have been passing the buck between them, can we accept that? Let us remind Ma and Wang of our central issue: &quot;Oppose CSSTA, Defend Democracy!&quot;</p><p></p><p>14:00 (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Hsiao-Wei Kuan from Department of Law, National Taipei University: &quot;In principle, the Pact is an agreement between Taiwan and China, not an administration order.&nbsp; At the mean time, the administration order can be debated, if it is decided by the Legislative Yuan. Because currently there is no formal way defining how to debate and proceed the agreement between Taiwan and China.&nbsp; That is the reason why there is a chance for the legislators playing these cards.&quot;</p><p></p><p>13:53 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [host] Let me remind all of us here of something, there were two media outlets photographing us earlier, and both have focused on the garbage situation; one took photos of our garbage pile, and the other took photos of us cleaning up our garbage. From this we can see that we need to continually focus on the little things, and like we have been reminding all of us all this time, we must keep the area clean.</p><p></p><p>13:47 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Students from Affiliated Senior High School of National Kaohsiung Normal University are sharing their opinion.</p><p></p><p>13:44 (Ching-Tao E. Rd) This evening at 7pm, there will be 6 buses departing from Chung Cheng Univ. to join and support us. (Applause.) We welcome friends to join us from all places. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>13:42 (Meeting Hall) Please clean the desk as clean as possible. Please move your bag and the personal belonging to other place, thank you.</p><p></p><p>13:41 (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Liang Guo-gan of the Academia Sinica said, &quot;I see many of our comrades in the police force hard at work on site. Last night I was walking around the 228 Memorial Park, our police comrades did not say much but still guided me home in a considerate manner, and I would like to thank them for it. In the next few days we may not be able to avoid clashes with our police comrades, but we ask that they perform their duties with a maximum of compassion and a minimum of force, because we are not violent hooligans.&quot;</p><p></p><p>13:40 (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Fan Yun: Previously, because the 228 Incident and its aftermath, Taiwanese people did not dare to be involved in political activities. But now we seem to be changing. We have Citizens 1985 and the unpaid workers from bankrupt factories taking our activism to the streets, but Taiwan currently has only a culture of protest but not a culture of organization. This is a terrible situation. When the media does not report these protests, or defame the protesters, our protests are rendered useless. It is only when our protests are organized, and companions can help each other by encouraging and connecting with each other, can we have a strong and durable movement. Therefore, if you are concerned that our democracy might face a regression, please cultivate your own ability to organize.</p><p></p><p>13:39 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) We have something special here. Just a moment ago we have a tourist from China threw over a note. It says: I want to tell you that you let me witness a historical moment, as well as the power of a mature democracy ... (omitted). Thank you to this friend of ours from China, thank you.</p><p></p><p>13:35 (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Fan Yun: A young democracy may regress. In order to form a stable democratic system we need the following: 1) capable political parties, 2) an impartial judiciary, 3) open and capable public media, 4) a strong and apolitical military, 5) a robust and vibrant civil society. Of all the factors above, Taiwan right now can only work on its civil society, but the other four factors can only improve within a robust civil society.</p><p></p><p>13:33 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Students from the Department of Sociology, National Sun Yat-sen University are sharing their experience.</p><p></p><p>13:31 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) At here we want to make a clarification. Some people probably are very emotional and sit on the wall with a panel said something like &quot;When do we rush into the Office of President?&quot; I need to clarify that we don&rsquo;t have any kind of event like that.&nbsp; What we are going to do is sitting here and supporting our people inside the Legislative Yuan.</p><p></p><p>13:20 (Jinan Rd.) Next, we will have a speech from Prof. Fan Yun from National Taiwan University&rsquo;s Department of Sociology, her speech is entitled, &quot;What use is Civil Society?&quot; (she is starting her noon roll call. There are students from the northern, central, southern, and eastern parts of Taiwan raising their hands, and even students from community colleges. Prof. Fan encourages everyone to check in on Facebook.)</p><p></p><p>13:19 (Meeting Hall) [Director]&nbsp; Everyone who has already had their meal please sit down at the sit-in area. And if you have your assigned position, please return to your position. For people who are sleeping at the sit-in area, please move to the back left area to rest so that we can keep the sit-in area for the sit-in protest only, thank you. People who are sitting in right now please gathering in the center area!&nbsp; For those of you at the No.3 exit, if you still need some rest, please move to the No.8 exit because we need the area at No.3 exit for storage, thank you.</p><p></p><p>13:18 (Ching-tao E. Rd.)&nbsp; Prof. Lin, Guo-ming from National Taiwan Univ. Dept of Sociology is now giving a speech.</p><p></p><p>13:16 (Jinan Rd.) Moderator (Prof. Liang, Linghong): Right now it is the time for people here in the first row to introduce yourselves to everyone.</p><p></p><p>13:14 (Jinan Rd.) Moderator (Prof. Liang, Linghong): This afternoon at 4:30, we will have several independent musicians coming to join us and cheer for us. Everyone please move forward, and please call and invite your friends. Let us fill up the front rows.</p><p></p><p>13:09 (Ching-tao E. Rd.) Hi everyone. We now have set up a resource center here at Ching-tao E. Rd, to centralize the coordination of resources and deliver over to those friends who are now inside the Meeting Hall. Please tell everyone, we now need bottled water, first aid supplies, including gauze, cotton swab, first aid kit, and saline solutions, fully charged portable batteries. If you know anyone who can be of help, please come register with us. Another thing, we now need volunteers. Starting from 2pm, we need 20 people in a shift, two hours a shift. We need people to help with distributing the resources, as well as with cleaning the environment. Many of our friends at Jinan Rd walked into the crowd to collect the trash. We think we can do the same here. We know we are all very orderly here, but we also need to make sure the environment is tidy. Once again, please tell everyone that we are now in need for first aid supplies. If you have friends who would like to make orders online, please just put &quot;Legislature Yuan, Ching-Tao E. Rd. In front of 7-11&quot; in the address column. Please help. Thank you everyone.</p><p></p><p>13:08 (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Hu from Soochow University: CSSTA has never been an administrative order. How can our Legislator pass it through committee by treating it as an administrative order?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>13:02 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) The people that are close to us please sit down if you can. We will have more and more people coming here, so please sit down or move to either side for more people can join us.</p><p></p><p>12:59 (Meeting Hall) The Internet connection is unstable right now causing the discontinuity of the live stream, but everything is fine.</p><p></p><p>12:57 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) (Short interruption of the speech) To everybody: please sit down, and leave a passage for people who wants to pass. Let&rsquo;s prevent any possible confrontation.</p><p></p><p>12:50 (Jinan Rd.) Attorney Chiu Hsian-Chi: I was at the Meeting Hall earlier, and I noticed that students are all very exhausted. It is unfortunate that the Government has not responded to students&rsquo; requests. The Government often use criminal law (assault, libel, etc) as a way to unduly pressure unarmed students and dissidents. I find this to be very unfair. Therefore we have organized a group of over 300 lawyers working pro-bono. Now they can pass the CSSTA in 30 seconds, will they pass some &quot;peace&quot; pact in the future in this manner as well? This is a terrifying possibility. If we tolerate this, we are burying democracy with our own hands.</p><p></p><p>12:50 (Jinan Rd.) Attorney Chiu from Eball Foundation is sharing experience.</p><p></p><p>12:48 (Meeting Hall) [Director] Those who have not received your lunch box please come and get yours ASAP. The leftover lunch boxes will be sent out of the Meeting Hall. Please, we all have to eat something to keep ourselves going. It&rsquo;s ok to share a box with one or two people. Just make sure you eat something.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>12:44 (Jinan Rd) Prof. Hsiao Shu-Chi from Shih-Hsin University:&nbsp; &quot;Stop thinking that the CSSTA does not have impacts on our daily lives, because labor importation that would be restricted by the CSSTA is limited to professionals and not blue- and white-collars. Right now our college grads earn only NT$22k/month on average; when the CSSTA opens our market to even cheaper labor, how can we believe we will not be impacted?&quot;(excerpt)</p><p></p><p>12:39 (Meeting Hall) [Broadcast] All of us here are pretty tired. Please find time and place to have a rest. We are not in need of resources at the moment. Please refrain from making spontaneous deliveries. We have a resource coordinating group that will handle this.</p><p></p><p>12:32 (Meeting Hall) [Applause and cheers]</p><p></p><p>12:31 (Meeting Hall) [director] I am glad that we lasted the night, students from Ching-yi University of Taichung have arrived in several buses and will join us shortly. More than 1,000 students and faculty from Taichung will come here this evening to lend their support as well. Some are unable to make the journey but yesterday they supported us at Meilidao Station and today they will support us from Taichung. Let us persevere together! (Cheers)</p><p></p><p>12:25 (Meeting Hall) [Broadcast]: It is now lunch time. We don&rsquo;t have any unexpected situation here in the Meeting Hall.</p><p></p><p>12:24 (Meeting Hall) [Director]: Those who have not had lunch please come and get your lunch box. We will be disposing the leftovers in a short while. So please come and get your lunch box ASAP if you haven&rsquo;t had lunch yet.</p><p></p><p>12:21 (Jinan Rd.) Right now Kimi, who is a student from Kobe Univ. in Japan, is sharing his experience with us. Now there are foreign students supporting our movement. So if you know any foreign language other than English, you can help us by telling what&rsquo;s happening to foreign media or friends. I am gay so please refrain from attacking other minority groups when speaking, you&rsquo;ll hurt us as well. I want to say, whether gay or straight, ethnic Chinese, ethnic Taiwanese, or aboriginal, you are all victims of this opaque trade pact. Let us win our battle while respecting our differences.</p><p></p><p>12:20 (Ching-tao E. Rd) A graduate student, Ms. Lee, from National Taiwan University Graduate School of Accounting addresses the crowd.</p><p></p><p>12:10 (Jinan Rd.) National Taiwan University School of Journalism Professor Chang Jing-hong is speaking on &quot;The effect CSSTA has on freedom of speech.&quot;</p><p></p><p>12:03 (Jinan Rd.) A little boy is lost from his parents. Please help to find him: he is 90 cm tall, two-years-and-3-month old, with a purple vest, wearing socks but no shoes. You can call him &quot;Gulu.&quot;</p><p></p><p>12:12 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Some pushing and shoving has occurred here, but order has been restored. Broadcaster: We support differences in opinions, because this is the hall of democracy!</p><p></p><p>12:07 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [director] We need twenty volunteers to maintain the order here. We need new people to replace previous members. Also, here we have to respect opinions from all different people. And let&rsquo;s also emphasize our slogans: &quot;Oppose CSSTA, defend democracy!&quot; Let&rsquo;s also welcome Ms. Lee from Nat&rsquo;l Taiwan Univ. to share her experience.</p><p></p><p>12:06 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Students from Pingtung Univ. of Science and Tech. share their experiences.</p><p></p><p>12:07 (Meeting Hall) [director] Please look around you to see if all your peers have had lunch. If not, please go to the lunch area and get your lunch boxes.</p><p></p><p>12:05 (Meeting Hall) [director] Raise your hand if you need vegetarian lunch. Please go to the lunch box area.</p><p></p><p>12:03 (Meeting Hall) [director] Then please assemble in the front at 12:40, and sit.</p><p></p><p>12:03 (Meeting Hall) Group : Yes!</p><p></p><p>12:01 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) Hello everybody, are we all fine? Have everybody ate lunch? If you haven&rsquo;t, please go there and get some lunch. Right now it is a bit unorganized here. Some of us had lunch and some haven&rsquo;t had lunch yet. We will set up a time. Please have your lunch before 12:40. After that, we need a cleanup about our stuff, because more people will be coming here.

Don&rsquo;t we have direct election for our legislators and the President? Yes, after the martial law is renounced, positions for elections have increased. In 1992, our Parliament finally has a general election. In 1994, Taipei and Kaohsiung&rsquo;s mayors were no longer appointed, but elected by the people. In 1996, we have direct election for the President. We become the electorate. Yet, not just that, we need to be citizens. Democracy does not end after we vote. We are not just voting. We need to be involved in policy-making process.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>09:31 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast] We are not out of electricity - thanks for concern from many people.

We will have a rotation mechanism, so that those inside can switch with those outside. But the staircase up to the second floor is blocked. If you need to get some fresh air, you can go outside to get refreshed. I know everyone is very tired after more than 36 hours. Let&rsquo;s give a round of applause.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>09:22 (Meeting Hall) [protesters] Rescind the agreement. Rescind the agreement.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>09:20 (Meeting Hall): [director] We know Chang Ching-Chung pass the agreement forcefully within only thirty seconds.

At the very Legislative Yuan, we want to tell all other citizens of our country, we reject the agreement!</p><p></p><p>09:1?&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) [director] We&rsquo;d like to speak again to President Ma: we ask to talk in person with you! We ask you to respond our request before the noon tomorrow! (applause)</p><p></p><p>09:1? (Meeting Hall) [director] Yesterday, at the Formosa Boulevard Station, Kaohsiung, thousands of people gathered at the station to support our movement in rescinding the agreement and defend our democracy.</p><p></p><p>09:1? (Meeting Hall) [Nat&rsquo;l Cheng-Kung Univ Student] Hi everyone, thanks for all your efforts. Many students from Cheng-Kung University and many people have just got 6 buses, calling 240 people. We have just arrived here this morning, fighting against the service and trade agreement. It is the first time for many of our students to participate in this type of events. We could not let the legislators neglect their duty of supervising the system. We could not let the businesses and govt to monopolize our future. We hope we could fight on and hang in there, until the Ma administration gave us a direct response. We cannot just pretend nothing happens. Thank you guys.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>09:1? (Meeting Hall) [director] Hello everybody, today at 5 am, 6 buses from&nbsp; Nat&rsquo;l Cheng-Kung Univ have arrived Taipei. Now they are here in Legislative Yuan. Now let&rsquo;s welcome friends from our best Cheng-Kung Univ. to speak with us.</p><p></p><p>09:06 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [director] <u>the following is a summary for the speech of the director:</u></p><p>&quot;Let&rsquo;s begin the press conference. First we should announce: We are here to oppose the CSSTA, and protect our Democracy!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We welcome all of our friends from the media. Since yesterday, we&rsquo;ve received waves of support rushing in from all sides,&nbsp; with hundreds of people helping to secure the meeting hall, and more than 20,000 have gathered outside in support. There are buses coming in from Tainan, Kaohsiung, and other areas to support us. Students at many schools throughout the country have staged strikes in support, and some college professors are coming with their students to experience this real-life lesson in democracy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We are representing the People, who want to take back our Parliament. We have demanded to speak with President Ma Ying-jeou, with the KMT legislative caucus, and with KMT speaker Wang Jin-pyng, but none has responded. They instead contend that the process has been entirely legal, and they are waiting for Friday&rsquo;s parliamentary vote of approval.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The agreement is not an administrative order, it is an agreement between two states...President Ma says the process has been completely reasonable and legal. We do not accept that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Our stance is very simple. The Services Agreement affects many market sectors and everyone&rsquo;s future. Its passage will result in closer economic and political integration with China, and therefore we need to be very careful in reviewing this agreement. However, the agreement was drafted in a black box, and there has been no communication with Taiwanese citizens at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We want the agreement to be rescinded---not just back to the committee, but we want it thrown out. We don&rsquo;t want an agreement that is made and decided in such a manner!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We demand Speaker Wang resolve the current situation in accordance with parliamentary rules and sanction Legislator Chang Ching-chung. We demand the Services Agreement be rescinded. We demand a Cross-Straits Agreements Regulation that allows the citizenry to oversee and regulate any agreements between Taiwan and China. Before this is in place, we demand that all negotiations with China be frozen.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Before tomorrow noon, we require your response to our demands. We invite President Ma to come to Parliament to speak with us. Tomorrow, at the time of the original scheduled vote, we demand Wang and Ma&rsquo;s response. If we do not receive a favorable response, we will announce further actions.&quot;</p><p>--- End of summary for the speech ---</p><ul class="comment"><li>[please edit as you see fit, hope this helps]&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>09:03 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Many people are taking some individuals actions out of context and saying that we&rsquo;re damaging public property. That is not actually happening. The press conference will be held inside the meeting hall, they are already getting ready.</p><p></p><p>08:58 (Meeting Hall) Director: Everybody please move and gather forward; those in the back gather in the back, fill that place up. No need for that many people over there(?) please spare a few hands and the rest of you can come to the front. Will our friends sitting by the wall also come to the front.</p><p></p><p>08:56 (Meeting Hall) Director: At 9 am we are going to have a press conference, in which we&rsquo;ll again persist and explain what we ask for. Therefore, for people in the back please come ahead together. Or if you are really tired you can also sleep at the back.</p><p></p><p>08:47 (Meeting Hall) Director: Gate 8 is open for everyone to go and use the restroom, but don&rsquo;t loiter outside; if there is any change in the situation we will shut the gate immediately, so please be quick.</p><p></p><p>08:44 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: The director is taking a break; we&rsquo;ll be taking over the broadcast from here. There are many people coming from around the island, if you have time from class or work, please come and join us. Also, thanks go out to those abroad and everyone with their attention on this issue in Taiwan, we will keep fighting on. Thank you everyone hosting events at other places; if it is inconvenient for you to come on-site you can also go to a local event near you.</p><p></p><p>08:43&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [director] It seems like people are getting hungry. We should eat more. We have just enough food. Although we&rsquo;ll never attack anybody, we still need energy to stand still. In the medical team there are also some vitamins, so you should come to us if you have any need, we&rsquo;ll also work hard to make sure you have anything you need. Thanks!</p><p></p><p>08:41&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) [director] New information: Buses from Nat&rsquo;l Dong-Hwa Univ. and Taitung Univ. is arriving at Taipei. We are already very thankful for the bus that arrived yesterday, and we cannot even dream for another. It takes a very long journey for them to come here for Taitung. But we all believe: the value of democracy in Taiwan needs to be protected by everybody. But we all believe: the value of democracy in Taiwan needs to be protected by everybody.</p><p></p><p>(The following is regarding speeches happening around 8:20~8:40 am from the team in Legislative Yuan. We are still trying our best to collect them, that&rsquo;s why you might find them in reverse order)</p><p></p><p>Let ma also explain, since last evening, many Taiwanese student who is studying abroad is very attached. Since they are far away, they team up and make a team for translating the situation into various different languages. They try their best to tell the international what&rsquo;s happening in Taiwan and draw their concern. Let&rsquo;s give them an applause! (applause)</p><p>It should be clear to all of us, that what have are doing here right now is not only for Taiwan, but also an important action for the value of democracy of human beings. Please insist on! Soon at 9 am we are holding a press conference, and we&rsquo;ll talk more about what we ask and demand. Please take a rest at the moment, and make sure you have your breakfast. Because there are many police officers around, please don&rsquo;t get along if you want to go outside.</p><p>So we are here. Not only worry about our independence of the economic, but our life in the future. So we are here to Reject the Pact! Protect the democracy!&nbsp; Thanks you all.</p><p>It is mentioned in the report from the AFP, everything about the relation between the Taiwan and China happened from 2008, the time that Ma Ying-jeou got the President position, how he use the excuse of maintaining the economic of Taiwan and China, how he got another round of President ship. And from the Associated Press, it is said that China enforced Taiwan constantly requesting the approval of the Pact. The interaction between Taiwan and China is more frequent after Ma Ying-jeou&rsquo;s Presidency. It is the biggest hope for the government of Beijing&nbsp; that enclosed the Taiwan into the mainland China.&nbsp; Can we endure our President and Legislators sale us out?&nbsp; (No!)</p><p>08:?? (Meeting Room) [director] Both newspaper and television media are watching our movement 24 hrs a day. Beside these news in Taiwan, we also see news from 10 different countries. Among them are news from Reuters, AFP, CNN, and news from Russia. They are all reporting the issues in great details, telling people how the action of KMT trying to force the Service and Trade Agreement to be passed have drawn attention, angry and worry from Taiwanese people. And so we stand here, hoping to be able to do something and fight for Taiwan society.</p><p>I have a good news here.&nbsp; There are some people in the Internet criticized us for violent, but we are very peaceful here, right? There is a opinion poll by Apple Daily, &quot;Do you think the students are making a mistake in this protest?&quot;&nbsp; And the result of this poll showing that more than 60 % of people agree that there is no mistake for students defending the democracy. This is the biggest encouragement to us, right? Protect the democracy! Reject the Pact.</p><p>Thanks for everyone holding up at here. Let&rsquo;s give all of us a round of applause, right?</p><p>And the Liberty Times also mentioned that the police assaulted for one time and didn&rsquo;t succeed. Is it true that the police only assaulted for one time? (No!) How many time the police assaulted? (Ten times!) No matter there are hundreds of polices, we must hold up here. We will reject the Pact, right? (Yes!) We have to stop everything here to grant an opportunity for reviewing the Pact once again, right?</p><p>Reject the Pact! Protect the democracy! So it is mentioned in the page 2 that there is only vote for the Pact but no further discussion. Should we ask Ma Ying-jeou for discussing the Pact once again? Right?&nbsp; (Yes!)</p><p>The headline of the Liberty Times is &quot;Requested by the students, reopen the negotiation of the Pact&quot;&nbsp; Does it necessary to reopen the negotiation of the Pact? (Yes!)</p><p>Reject the Pact! Protect the democracy!</p><p>At here, I want to specially thank the reporter Huang of United Daily News.&nbsp; He wrote a report with the title &quot;The failure of the elected representation&quot;. Let&rsquo;s thanks to him, okay? (applause) The elected representation is indeed failed, and we cannot let it happen in the future, right?</p><p>(applause)</p><p>Another page is the support from the students of Mei-Li-Tao. People who can not be here in Taipei, but they were gathering at the Mei-Li-Tao station at Kaohsiung to give their support.&nbsp; Please give them some applause.</p><p>It was said that the medical doctors gathered via the Internet and share the shifts by volunteer.&nbsp; Please give them some applause everyone, say thank you to all of them, all right?</p><p>(Cheer from the whole court)</p><p>There were more than 20000 people gathering here. It was said by the United Daily News that the DPP has already enlarged their manpower.&nbsp; It was mentioned specifically to our volunteering medical doctors.&nbsp; Please give them some applause, okay?</p><p>After that, we want to share with everybody about the news from United Daily News. Oh I like their headline - &quot;The police have no means&quot; and another &quot;The Congress has fallen.&quot; This means there are really afraid, aren&rsquo;t they? Because the police knows this is really the very right of the citizens, so they are not going across the line, aren&rsquo;t they?</p><p>(Editor remark: United Daily News and China Times are usually recognized as media which supports the KMT party and/or sides with China)</p><p>And we are here to thank so many reporter, friends in the media for their dedicating work on the report. And thank for so many managers in the media for holding up their position, their job to deliver the reports close to what happens here. Thank you.</p><p>Reject the Pact! Protect the democracy.</p><p>In page A3 (of China Times), it&rsquo;s said that the congress (a.k.a. Legislative Yuan) has gone into its most dark era. Is it because of us? No! We&rsquo;re here, because we don&rsquo;t want our congress to be in the dark, but rather become a place of democracy and brightness. Right?</p><p>In page A2 (of China Times), Ma Ying-jeou yesterday support the team of KMT to deal with this in a peaceful, reasonable and lawful way to deal with this. If he really wants so, shouldn&rsquo;t he try to talk to us? Please, Ma Ying-jeou, talk to us! What the KMT party did in their congress are really ridiculous instead.</p><p>Good morning, everyone! I have the China Times in my hand!</p><p>They are worried all of us inside the Legislative Yuan for not having a good sleep and good food. (in sarcastic way) But actually we are holding up well. All right, the main idea of the report in the Apple Daily is the following. Wang Jin-pyng has won the lawsuit regarding his position of the President of the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, there is no worry about the President position right now. So, when this President of Legislative Yuan will put the attention to this Protest? Face the Protest, Wang Jin-Pyng! Face the Protest, President Wang.</p><p>Desert Xuan stood out for us last night. And she also mentioned in her facebook that if after sunset...</p><p>(Cheer from the whole court)</p><p>A6 of Apple Daily writes, &quot;the way the information flows and connects is the Taiwanese version of the Jasmine Revolution.&quot; Regarding citizens demanding the rights back, when we are inside the Parliament, there are many people, such as Masa from Mayday, supporting the students. There was also a cafe which announces for closing for today, saying &quot;Taiwan&rsquo;s future is more important than the income of the shop.&quot;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s see, we have got to the national flag in the top floor, for letting everybody see the honor of the congress. Right?</p><p>Our dear police officers, they are our comrades across from us. They are actually on the same side as us! Right?</p><p>In fact, the whole page is two sections, the cooperation for protesting the Pact.&nbsp; There were six buses arrived from Taichung yesterday and the day before yesterday. The students and schools that participated in this Protest spent their own money for being here with all of us at Legislative Yuan. We are having a real lecture of democracy at here, the Legislative Yuan, for all of the students.</p><p>Please tell me what does it mean in the report. Before the beginning of the Committee, the Pact has already pass the Committee review.&nbsp; Is it the way with rationality? That is because you, KMT legislators ignored the spirit of this Legislative Yuan!&nbsp; Reject the Pact!&nbsp; Protect the democracy!</p><p>[audience] Right!</p><p>The headline of Apple Daily: The wave of the protest from student is arising!&nbsp; The largest one in 24 years is here in Taiwan. And then the next thing they mentioned is the President of Legislative Yuan encourage students to stay calm.&nbsp; Is there anytime that we are not in calm, we are not keep our rationality?&nbsp; Please come here to take look okay, President Wang.</p><p>(Here begin some speeches happening during 8:20~8:40 am in Legislative Yuan)</p><p></p><p>08:20 (Ching-Tao)&nbsp; [director] For friends in Ching-Tao E. Rd. and 鎮江 St., please sit down&nbsp; as ahead as possible and guard the door, to prevent the police to push&nbsp; the line to the congress.</p><p></p><p>08:14 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [on-site leader] Guys, take a look at your partners.

The broadcast is telling everybody that today many people might receive message (Remark: From the government). If you do so you should just ignore them. We should avoid making any panic, and any trap from political parties. Thank you!</p><p></p><p>08:03 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast] In a few minutes two students from Nat&rsquo;l Chung-Cheng Univ. will come and replace me. Thank you!

Please hold on, after the just-arriving group come we can take turn to take showers.</p><p></p><p>05:45 (Ching-Tao E. Rd. site) Friends who said they want a group singing can come to us. There is a gentleman who can help on the background music.</p><p></p><p>05:39 (Ching-Tao E. Rd. site) Six buses that came from Tainan is arriving, and 300 students are joining us.

Make sure we behave well. Also since&nbsp; there are many resources coming, please help with the trash thus&nbsp; produced and keep the site clean. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>05:10&nbsp; (Ching-Tao E.

Rd.&nbsp; there are two police cars which get put a lots of Post-it note. Please&nbsp; DON&rsquo;T do it. Thanks!</p><p></p><p>05:09 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall)&nbsp; [broadcaster] It starts to rain outside, please support the friends&nbsp; outside by sending them the rain gears.</p><p></p><p>05:06 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcaster] The air conditioner is turned off right now. By the way, in London we have people in Taiwan who wants to express support to us.</p><p></p><p>05:05 (Internet) <a href="http://goo.gl/msoErd"></a><a href='http://goo.gl/msoErd'/>http://goo.gl/msoErd</a> This is a petition to the white house.

Please be on guard our citizen friends here in the meeting hall!!</p><p></p><p>04:43 (Ching-Tao E. Rd. site) For friends here who is free, you may help us cleaning the site, reducing the work load of our team. If you&rsquo;d like to smoke or drink, that&rsquo;s ok. Just be careful not to do things that might allow some media to produce negative news on us.</p><p></p><p>04:41 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcaster] Thanks to people who have been helping on word broadcast. Answering a question of foreign friends: we have been here for two days.</p><p></p><p>04:40 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [Broadcaster]&nbsp; Bottled water is needed in here; our sites outside can use some bug repellents; there are many mosquitoes out there. It&rsquo;s about dawn time; please take care.</p><p></p><p>04:38 (Ching-Tao E Rd site) We have fewer people at Lin-Son S Rd side (such that the police is easier to breakthrough from there). We encourage friends who just came here to move over there (to fortify the spot). Also a friendly reminder that please refrain trash and cigarette ashes to proper disposition.</p><p></p><p>04:34 (Ching-Tao site) Right now we are a bit short of resources. Please tell your friends about this - we are in need of food. Instant noodle will not help, since we have no access of hot water. Please send these resource to the resource station on Ching-Tao E. Rd. Thank you very much!</p><p></p><p>04:32 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [Broadcaster] If there is no clear reaction until Friday, the demonstration is not going to be removed on the weekend. Some people inside the Meeting Hall need to leave and rest. The air inside is quite bad. The power plugs on the second floor are still working; on the first floor we are not sure.</p><p></p><p>04:30 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [Broadcaster] The time is 4:30 am. The police have taken no action so far. It&rsquo;s still peaceful in Legislative Yuan.</p><p></p><p>04:23 <i>(Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [Broadcaster] The time is 4:23 am. Everything seems all right here.</i></p><p></p><p>04:19&nbsp; (Ching-Tao E Rd site) [broadcaster] If&nbsp; anyone find an unknown broadcasting vehicle around Ching-Tao E Rd and&nbsp; Lin-Son S Rd that is trying to agitate the crowds, please help to ask it&nbsp; to leave.</p><p></p><p>04:13&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [Broadcaster] The resting friends have all one by one awoken. We are communicating to the people outside and they are preparing breakfast to deliver it into the parliament.</p><p></p><p>04:11&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ching-Tao E. Rd site) Again safety is important. Make sure you are with other people. If you meet somebody dangerous or aggressive, you can still ask for help from the police. There was just an Apple Daily news saying there are gangsters around and driven away by the police.</p><p></p><p>04:01 <i>(Meeting Hall) [Broadcaster] It is now 4 AM, while the police has not launched further actions. Currently there&rsquo;s no way (for people outside) to enter the Legislative Yuan.</i></p><p></p><p>03:58 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Bon courage, everyone in the building or outside or in front of your computer screen. Right now there is a limit on the number of people allowed in the building, so free passage is not permitted. Silent protest outside is also important for our cause. Everybody counts.</p><p></p><p>03:54&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Apologies to the friend who sent egg rolls from Hsinchu; please post on facebook or contact your friends outside the area by yourself. We do not have communications with the outside. It&rsquo;s almost 4am, good job all.</p><p></p><p>03:50&nbsp; <i>(Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Please will everyone focus on &quot;Opposing the STA, Protecting our Democracy.&quot; Don&rsquo;t be misled by issues like who&nbsp; is reporting the events or other thing like that. Right now we do not&nbsp; have free access in or out of the building, and the first floor is&nbsp; poised for conflict.</i></p><p></p><p>03:48&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Just now the director explained that if you are dragged out by the police, please take a taxi back to ChingDao E. Rd. to continue protesting. If you are sent to the Control Yuan, please call the Judical Reform Foundation or your lawyer. You can remain silent until your lawyer arrives. I&rsquo;m not familiar with law issues, and so won&rsquo;t be able to answer you, apologies.</p><p></p><p>03:45 (Ching-Tao) Director: Someone has donated a&nbsp; guitar; we welcome anyone to come and perform. Please be careful when&nbsp; climbing over the walls, so as not to damage public property such as&nbsp; CCTV cameras. Be careful in your actions.</p><p></p><p>03:43&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall)&nbsp; [broadcaster]&nbsp; We need medical staff tomorrow morning around 7 AM. We&nbsp; are short of 15 people. We expect to maintain a medical staff of 30&nbsp; persons here. Thank you in advance for those medical staff who can come&nbsp; to the scene and support us.</p><p></p><p>03:38&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Personally, I don&rsquo;t think we should ever target at media reporters even if they are hostile against us, since they&rsquo;re just doing their job. We just want to attain the change we want: &quot;Oppose the STA, Protect our Democracy,&quot; that&rsquo;s all. The Anti-Intransparency event in Taichung will be held at 19:00 (7pm), 3/20, at the Citizen&rsquo;s Square.</p><p></p><p>03:35 (Ching-Tao) Broadcaster: The Civil Forum going on at ChingDao E. Rd. is going on without incident.</p><p></p><p>03:34&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster:&nbsp; Thank you everyone, we have sufficient supply now, thanks.</p><p></p><p>03:32&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Compared to yesterday&rsquo;s situation, all the police from north of Changhwa have been gathered here, so hopefully everyone will come support us; we need to surround the police and not let them surround us. We also have sufficient medical personnel inside, as you can see on the right hand side of the feed. We know the police are not after us personally; it&rsquo;s because there is this protest that they have to be here, we all want this to go down peacefully. As for safety problems, we are peaceful both inside and outside the building right now, everyone is safe, do not worry.</p><p></p><p>03:29 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: There are more media people on the second floor (of the meeting room), so there is no shortage of power there, please do not worry. If you&rsquo;re tired get some rest for now.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:23 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: According to sources, the next important time might be 4am, it&rsquo;s 3:22am right now. We believe that our pleas will be heard. We expect to continue this occupation until Friday, when the Legislative Yuan meeting takes place.&nbsp; We do not yet have a Japanese translator, so we cannot explain to our Japanese friends, apologies. If you are coming to the protest, please come with friends; the police will detain loners. We have not heard about the event in Taitung. However we are sure there will be an anti-intransparency rally in Tainan tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>03:22 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: We&rsquo;re not offline; if the feed disappears try reloading the webpage. All supplies are sufficient at this point; not need to send more in. You can reach the Legislative Yuan from exit 2 of the MRT NTU Hospital Station or exit M8 of Taipei Main Station.</p><p></p><p>03:20 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: We&rsquo;re seeing Taiwanese in London posting about the incident on facebook, helping us protect our democracy. Great job guys.</p><p></p><p>03:19 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: I&rsquo;m not sure what time on Friday the Legislative Yuan meeting will be held; that needs to be fact-checked. Apologies.</p><p></p><p>03:18 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast] Basically Friday will be the most important day, because it&rsquo;s the day when the Service and Trade Agreement is to be brought up in Legislative Yuan. We will then see if we need to take further actions, like a parade or so. It will be an important time for the current issue and society. Right now in Legislative Yuan we still have the electricity on the second floor, and but so sure about the first floor. No matter where you are watching us from, you are more than welcomed to come to Taipei and join us. We don&rsquo;t know if Apple Daily is still live broadcasting what&rsquo;s happening here. If you are tired, you should probably just go to sleep and come to stand with us tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>03:18 (ChingDao) Director: If anyone has anything to say, you&rsquo;re welcome to pass me a note.</p><p></p><p>03:15 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Thank you everyone, this stream was started by DaGe (Big Brother), though we&rsquo;re not making any money, we&rsquo;re doing this out of our own will. The video may be a bit spotty due to bad reception. You may need to bring your own water if you&rsquo;re planning to go the bathroom. The time is 3:15, there has not been an assault, thank you for your continued support.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:12 (Meeting Hall) Broadcast Announcer: Hi everyone, we have enough drinking water in the meeting room already; but there is not enough tap water to wash our hands or flush the toilets. The AC seems to be on, but it is very weak. Please do not worry; though there are people sleeping, we have arranged students to be on alert at every door in preparation for a police assault. The television media has also been with us all this time.</p><p></p><p>03:05&nbsp; (Ching-Tao E Rd ) We are having Civil Forum, and people from everywhere are coming up to the stage to share their opinions.</p><p></p><p>03:01&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Broadcast Announcer: Here&rsquo;s a report; everything is alright in the meeting room right now. Thank you all for staying with us up until now, no matter if you&rsquo;re here on site or not, we are making Taiwanese history. The video may be blurry because it was moved or there&rsquo;s a problem with focusing.</p><p></p><p>02:57&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast announcer]&nbsp; On the right side of the meeting room there is our medical team who are dressed in white. They are there in preparation for the expected police charge or power shutdown, which could happen soon. Hang in there everyone. Now the time is close to the said police charge time, which could be anytime between 3 AM to 5 AM.</p><p></p><p>02:54&nbsp; (Meeting hall) Live Streamer: The previous report may have caused some negative views, and we apologise for that. It&rsquo;s 2:54am, and we&rsquo;re waiting to see if the police will act at 3am. On the right is our E light, our medical station.</p><p></p><p>02:52&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [announcement from the stage] Time is 2:50 AM. Please take some rest; you will be notified with any situation. Again, please rest, and get closer to people you know.</p><p></p><p>02:51&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast announcer] We don&rsquo;t have water to wash the toilets or wash our hands. As for electricity, there is still power on the second floor.</p><p></p><p>02:48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast announcer] because of lack of equipment, we are still using ipad for the online video broadcast. Beside this, we have plenty of food and drinkable water here. The DPP party had promised to provide future necessary resources. Right now we have no facebook page. We are waiting for further moves from the polices, and hope you’ll keep with us.</p><p></p><p>02:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ChingDao) Director: Those attending the Civil Forum are welcome to join us. The crowd is growing, so would everyone please remain disciplined outside and do not push around.</p><p></p><p>02:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (From southern Taiwan) People in Kaohsiung are fighting with us.</p><p></p><p>02:47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast announcer] Right now we are having some meals. People should go to the restroom if needed and take a rest, and wait for future actions of the police if any. Let’s cheer up.</p><p></p><p>02:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Director: Here’s a report; we have enough supplies right now, but water is crucial; there are a lot of unclaimed water bottles at the podium, please will everybody take care of the resources we have.</p><p></p><p>02:42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan reporter) Right now in the Legislative Yuan we are short of water for washing hands and toilet. Also we now do security checks for entering the meeting room; for example we discovered a hammer and get rid of it.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) We’ve just received news that besides the aggregation of police, the street leading to the back door of the Legislative yuan has also been controlled. Because we control the front and side gates, they may attempt to drag us out from there. Everyone sit more loosely and relax for now, but don’t relax too much either.</p><p></p><p>02:44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ching-Tao E. Rd) 5 Tour buses from Southern Taiwan just arrived at the site, with about 250 people.</p><p></p><p>02:40&nbsp;&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) LS Cameraman: Are you all familiar with the STA? There are a lot of people posting links on facebook today, you can click one of those to know more; we are peaceful and rational, we don’t want to conflict with the police.</p><p></p><p>02:38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Meeting Room) Live stream cameraman: I’’ll adjust the angle to give a better view and charge the camera.</p><p></p><p>02:36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall Broadcast Announcer: There could be some enemy spies among us in this meeting room. We will watch out; people here all keep an eye on anyone who we don’t know.</p><p></p><p>02:35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) Director: Defend Taiwan!

(both sides, outside the Legislative Yuan). If the police is smart, they will not close in unto us (who are in the meeting room), in that if the police closes in, they may be closed in (by our partners outside) too. So we are relatively safe staying inside here, today. People outside are guarding the legislation of the country, just like us who are inside. They are not here for a concert.</p><p></p><p>02:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ChingDao) Student from Hong Kong: Hope Taiwan won’t end up like Hong Kong, I’m here to support!</p><p></p><p>02:27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Moving) Director at Jinan St.: Police are friendly to student.

We might have different opinions, but please don’t be aggressive toward the police officers - they are just following the order of their managers. We would like to have a peaceful protest, and we simply want to defend our democracy and against the current Service and Trade Agreement.</p><p></p><p>02:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) Announcer: Sorry, we had to reboot the network, which might cause interruption of the live broadcast.
