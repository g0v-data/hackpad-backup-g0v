<p>============================↓ Live Broadcast Below ↓============================</p><p>Timezone is GMT +8</p><p></p><p>19:36 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) it is estimated that we have more than 15000 people here now. reserve your energy...we are afraid during 3-5AM the police will start the action...please come back at that time.</p><p></p><p>19:36 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) too many people lining up to speak...we pause the registration for a while...please keep your belonging safe too...</p><p></p><p>19:35 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) I was wondering if it makes sense if I stand up. But does it make any sense to eat or to sleep? Just believe your faith, that makes things different. It makes sense if I can make people in the main hall persist for one min longer.</p><p></p><p>19:19 ((Ching-Tao E. Rd.) student from TKU. before the student occupied the Parliament, anyone of you understand the free trade with China? I think it is minor. So we have to thank them for attracting the public opinion. And thanks for the volunteers here. smart people are the government.</p><p></p><p>19:17 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) please control yourself the media reporters. we are not controlled by any political party. we are all volunteers. I hope the government can make it transparent, fair and public. Please share with your friends with the situation here. cheer up. thanks.</p><p></p><p>18:27 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.)&nbsp; I am from the Taipei University. Until yesterday, I was focusing on my thesis. I did not know anything about outside. Now I put off everything to join. I&rsquo;ve never been so angry. Even though I study so much, I can&rsquo;t really analyze the pros and cons of the free trade. I am not so professional. But we are in a democratic country, we have to do in the democratic way. whether the free trade is good nor not, I am disappoint that the ruling party does not obey the formal law making process. Hope the government do not be blind, just come out and accept our opinion.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>18:26 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.)&nbsp; Now we have so many people, the police won&rsquo;t move...because we are the real power of people.</p><p></p><p>18:24 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.)&nbsp; I read the content of ECFA. It&rsquo;s unfair. I am not against it. But do not do in the blackbox. we should make a documentary of President Ma. so no future politicians can learn the lesson.</p><p></p><p>18:18 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) I want to say...I am fucking so tired...but we are not afraid...we&rsquo;d rather be tired for days, not for life. Thank you .</p><p></p><p>18:16 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) This evening this is the open forum for students here. everyone can give a short speech. please register for the line-up.</p><p></p><p>18:15 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) We will also have lectures today, teaching everyone what the free trade act mean.</p><p></p><p>18:14 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) The deadline for the President to respond is tomorrow&rsquo;s noon. Or there will be more actions. We will not leave the Legislative Yuan. We will have more declaration later.</p><p></p><p>18:13 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Student from Dept. Chemistry of NTU: Use your mobile phones, LINE, facebook to share this information with your friends. Protect the democracy! Thanks.</p><p></p><p>18:11 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Host: Though it rained just now, we have as many as people yesterday now.</p><p></p><p>18:05 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) now the rain coats are distributing, the forum is starting.&nbsp; Welcome Mr. Yu (an elementary teacher). I risks my career to be here because I am a public school teacher. I heard people asking why the students here do not go to class, why they care the economics to much. Today, we stand here, do we stand out for any politician? No we stand here for the people. I majored economics in the university. Ask yourself, does our current government makes your life better? I like to say something to my student. I can&rsquo;t speak this in the school. but I am very proud to be here. We adult are shameful because we can&rsquo;t protect your future. Please protect the children&rsquo;s future.</p><p></p><p>17:34 (Jinan Rd.) Student from Shih Shin University: My life [before this event] was essentially a loser; I&rsquo;ve heard that 3G connection is spotty here, but perhaps you have seen this message about news stations covering this event: This is why we are against media&rsquo;s monopoly on news -- during the Wild Lilies protest&nbsp; in 1990, the mainstream newsletter ChinaTimes had a lot more guts than media nowadays; they accepted a donation box nearby their new station, taking small donations (NTD$100 or $1000) to put a half-page advertisement on their newspaper to show that they sympathize with the Wild Lilies student protestors. But are today&rsquo;s media doing the same? Are they feeling the weight of the current event? When they are all muted by censorship, would the journalists here think twice about your professionalism, and how partisan politics have strangled your freedom of press? However, all of us are all reporters here, because we can use our own Facebook accounts, our own phones, to let the world know that is happening today. Who is the mainstream, and who is the fringe? When the news anchors are covering the &quot;My Love from the Star&quot; TV series, and we are covering the Dapu [eminent domain dispute] Incident, the TISA agreement -- who exactly is the fringe media here? Everybody, please carry on. Rock on. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>17:20 (Jinan Rd.) Pastor: As a pastor, my vocation and duties are: Intercession [praying for other people], blessing, and to protect others. For example, I take the bus each morning, and talk to high school students crowded on the same bus. I&rsquo;m very impressed, really, that the students are willing to get up early and strive. If students are not willing to stand out, Taiwan would have no hope at all. I remember when I was young, during the Ilha Formosa Incident, which I&rsquo;ve participated. The TISA incident of late seemed like a reenactment of that. We often prayed for the Taiwan government, which is very tiring, because we don&rsquo;t see such universal values such as democracy and mutual respect.&nbsp; The State puts restriction on you, but you are still willing to come out, so please continue to hold this faith, this willingness to contribute. Perhaps our generation did not contribute enough, so you&rsquo;d still need to continue this work. Were you not willing to come out, we wouldn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to sit here today. I won&rsquo;t use provocative words here, but I will pray for everyone with my own way: Father God, we thank you for giving us the beautiful island of Taiwan, which is where our ancestors lived, and we are willing to guard the place, thank you so we are willing to come out; whether we are in the field of congress, or sitting here in the harsh weather, we are here for the people. Lord, grant us the spirit of wisdom, strength and courage. I beg you also help the President Ma, please remove his ignorance and incompetence. Please have mercy on Taiwan and bless our young people. Rise them so they know what is charity, freedom, equality, and grant them physical and mental health, I pray thee, keep them, so they can be free from fears and worries, looking up to God in their pursuit of truth. Thank the Lord, thank you.</p><p></p><ul class="comment"><li>Missing: 15:32 ~ 17:17 from <a href="https://ethercalc.org/static/proxy/hackpad/"></a>https://ethercalc.org/static/proxy/hackpad/ - volunteers wanted:&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>15:28 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) The trading agreement has opened many of the public service industry, and those are our precious public property such as water, airport, and even nature enviromnet.</p><p></p><p>15:15 (Meeting Hall) Idea sharing by student from National Taiwan University.</p><p></p><p>15:15 (Meeting Hall) Idea sharing by student from Law School Sophomore, Soochow University.</p><p></p><p>15:14 (Meeting Hall) [director] There are two student wish to share. We hope to have more of us to stand out and share their idea. (Lost of internet connection)</p><p></p><p>15:13 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [director] let&rsquo;s evaluate this trading agreement and the current economy in Taiwan. We wish to have a better economical analysis. The statement from our government suggest people to join the trading agreement; otherwise, we may loss our competitiveness and further causing serious issue in Taiwan. We must ask the following questions. What has our government done for us? Why should we rely ourselves on the country which desperate to annex us. Tiding us to them, do you believe it is right? (No we don&rsquo;t). Is it really good for Taiwan to use this analogy and to have this cooperation with the other market? What have we seen? Therefore, it is the best to have a smaller government, and everything should be released to people. e.g. Water Department could be run by civilian cooperation. Also, we were all mad on ETC or the difficulty on running Taiwan High Speed Rail. The benefit of releasing those utility to private cooperation is the growth on GDP. But, those are just his hypothesis. Was not ECFA suppose to be the solution given by the government? (Lost of internet connection)</p><p></p><p>15:10 (Meeting Hall) [director] Is there any students from the National Tung Hua University? Here is a letter from the principal of the National Tung Hua University. (Sorry for the bad Internet connection)</p><p></p><p>15:07 (Meeting Hall) People on the scene has shared</p><p></p><p>15:01 (Meeting Hall) [director] Everyone, we have a very good news today. Our news is reported by a newspaper at Sri Lanka. Our effort and the value that we are defending is delivered to all of the world. Please give yourselves a round of applause! (applause) Is there any students from the National Chung Cheng University? No? That&rsquo;s fine, because there are six buses coming from there.</p><p></p><p>14:58 (Meeting Hall) [speaker] This is a hard road we&rsquo;re on. I&rsquo;ve been following all of you for the last 3 days on Facebook, and so decided to come up from Chiayi. I am worried for your welfare and what you might do in the future. My fellow students, you are now exemplars to all, and some people have been examining your every move under a microscope; please be careful, okay? (Yes!) Also, we can not stay here forever, one day we will leave. Please understand the position of our police force, they are also under tremendous pressure. Let&rsquo;s be considerate of them together, okay? (Yes!)&nbsp; I also hope that all of you will stand up and move around a bit, because the Hall is really stuffy. Please feel free to tell me of anything you need, I will try to coordinate with the police. The most important thing is that I hope all of you will stay safe and be careful of your conduct, thank you.</p><p></p><p>14:45 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) The host introduces every university of which has participated.</p><p></p><p>14:43 (Meeting Hall) [director] Yesterday when the webcast was interrupted were we all nervous? When we couldn&rsquo;t get our message out someone passed a note in, and it said, &quot;Only a wall divides us, our hearts are together!&quot; I know that CNN began to report our actions only because many of our fellow students here have been compiling information and sending them out. We now have protesters from more than 50 schools around the country participating here, let&rsquo;s give them our applause! We are unable to list all schools here, we&rsquo;ll compile a list later this evening, and we apologize for that. I also know that we are a multi-talented group, some of us can sing and play guitar, some are in performance groups or can do comedy crosstalk, right now we don&rsquo;t have air conditioning and the Hall is stuffy; if you possess a talent please go see the bald handsome dude in the back.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>14:40 (Jinan Rd.) Taiwanese Premier Jiang Yi-huah responded to the CSSTA controversy with, &quot;Thank you for your opinions, please respect democracy.&quot; Can you accept this response? (No!) Who is really destroying our democracy?</p><p></p><p>14:30 (Jinan Rd.) As of now, there has more than 200 teachers volunteered for street lecture on the topic of &quot;Democratic Rights&quot;.</p><p></p><p>14:24 (Jinan Rd.) The democracy lecture on the street: Prof. Lin Guo-Ming from Department of Sociology, National Taiwan University &quot;The Pact, the right of resist and Deliberative Democracy&quot; &quot;What is deliberative democracy that is the policy need to have the space for discussion.&nbsp; When the government makes the policy, the government cannot force the people to accept everything by saying that we are the government or we are the relative large group.&nbsp; Politics is not a head count, a policy need to convince people by describing its influence and the subject that will be affected by this policy.&nbsp; The worry from the people should be released and the government has to make sure that different side of the opinion can be heard in the process of making the decision. Does the process of deliberative democracy happen in the process of negotiating the Pact?&quot;&nbsp; (No!)</p><p></p><p>14:24 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) The singing is leading by the students from National Yang Ming University</p><p></p><p>14:12 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [director] This protest will continue for a long time. We must hold on to our faith.</p><p></p><p>14:07 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [director] Friends, we have been working hard, are we tired? I am glad to see all of us still defending this place. After we have announced our ultimatum at the press conference, we have received a reply from President Ma Ying-jeou and Parliament Speaker Wang Jing-ping. I think our friends in the press here already know what that reply is, but I would like to make a report on it to the rest of us here anyway. Before today we have always known that Speaker Wang may exercise his police power inside the Legislature to remove us, but as he believes this demonstration is a matter for law and order, he has refrained from doing so. We have been here two days and neither President Ma nor Speaker Wang has given us a response. Therefore we announce that we will not leave this Meeting Hall before a formal response from the government is given, and if we have no response before Friday 12:30 pm, we will not rule out the possibility of further actions. We demand an answer from President Ma, that he should respond to the people. Thank you all for being here. Us friends inside and outside the Meeting Hall have been here for more than 40 hours, but President Ma and Speaker Wang have been passing the buck between them, can we accept that? Let us remind Ma and Wang of our central issue: &quot;Oppose CSSTA, Defend Democracy!&quot;</p><p></p><p>14:00 (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Hsiao-Wei Kuan from Department of Law, National Taipei University: &quot;In principle, the Pact is an agreement between Taiwan and China, not an administration order.&nbsp; At the mean time, the administration order can be debated, if it is decided by the Legislative Yuan. Because currently there is no formal way defining how to debate and proceed the agreement between Taiwan and China.&nbsp; That is the reason why there is a chance for the legislators playing these cards.&quot;</p><p></p><p>13:53 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) [host] Let me remind all of us here of something, there were two media outlets photographing us earlier, and both have focused on the garbage situation; one took photos of our garbage pile, and the other took photos of us cleaning up our garbage. From this we can see that we need to continually focus on the little things, and like we have been reminding all of us all this time, we must keep the area clean.</p><p></p><p>13:47 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Students from Affiliated Senior High School of National Kaohsiung Normal University are sharing their opinion.</p><p></p><p>13:44 (Ching-Tao E. Rd) This evening at 7pm, there will be 6 buses departing from Chung Cheng Univ. to join and support us. (Applause.) We welcome friends to join us from all places. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>13:42 (Meeting Hall) Please clean the desk as clean as possible. Please move your bag and the personal belonging to other place, thank you.</p><p></p><p>13:41 (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Liang Guo-gan of the Academia Sinica said, &quot;I see many of our comrades in the police force hard at work on site. Last night I was walking around the 228 Memorial Park, our police comrades did not say much but still guided me home in a considerate manner, and I would like to thank them for it. In the next few days we may not be able to avoid clashes with our police comrades, but we ask that they perform their duties with a maximum of compassion and a minimum of force, because we are not violent hooligans.&quot;</p><p></p><p>13:40 (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Fan Yun: Previously, because the 228 Incident and its aftermath, Taiwanese people did not dare to be involved in political activities. But now we seem to be changing. We have Citizens 1985 and the unpaid workers from bankrupt factories taking our activism to the streets, but Taiwan currently has only a culture of protest but not a culture of organization. This is a terrible situation. When the media does not report these protests, or defame the protesters, our protests are rendered useless. It is only when our protests are organized, and companions can help each other by encouraging and connecting with each other, can we have a strong and durable movement. Therefore, if you are concerned that our democracy might face a regression, please cultivate your own ability to organize.</p><p></p><p>13:39 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) We have something special here. Just a moment ago we have a tourist from China threw over a note. It says: I want to tell you that you let me witness a historical moment, as well as the power of a mature democracy ... (omitted). Thank you to this friend of ours from China, thank you.</p><p></p><p>13:35 (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Fan Yun: A young democracy may regress. In order to form a stable democratic system we need the following: 1) capable political parties, 2) an impartial judiciary, 3) open and capable public media, 4) a strong and apolitical military, 5) a robust and vibrant civil society. Of all the factors above, Taiwan right now can only work on its civil society, but the other four factors can only improve within a robust civil society.</p><p></p><p>13:33 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) Students from the Department of Sociology, National Sun Yat-sen University are sharing their experience.</p><p></p><p>13:31 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) At here we want to make a clarification. Some people probably are very emotional and sit on the wall with a panel said something like &quot;When do we rush into the Office of President?&quot; I need to clarify that we don&rsquo;t have any kind of event like that.&nbsp; What we are going to do is sitting here and supporting our people inside the Legislative Yuan.</p><p></p><p>13:20 (Jinan Rd.) Next, we will have a speech from Prof. Fan Yun from National Taiwan University&rsquo;s Department of Sociology, her speech is entitled, &quot;What use is Civil Society?&quot; (she is starting her noon roll call. There are students from the northern, central, southern, and eastern parts of Taiwan raising their hands, and even students from community colleges. Prof. Fan encourages everyone to check in on Facebook.)</p><p></p><p>13:19 (Meeting Hall) [Director]&nbsp; Everyone who has already had their meal please sit down at the sit-in area. And if you have your assigned position, please return to your position. For people who are sleeping at the sit-in area, please move to the back left area to rest so that we can keep the sit-in area for the sit-in protest only, thank you. People who are sitting in right now please gathering in the center area!&nbsp; For those of you at the No.3 exit, if you still need some rest, please move to the No.8 exit because we need the area at No.3 exit for storage, thank you.</p><p></p><p>13:18 (Ching-tao E. Rd.)&nbsp; Prof. Lin, Guo-ming from National Taiwan Univ. Dept of Sociology is now giving a speech.</p><p></p><p>13:16 (Jinan Rd.) Moderator (Prof. Liang, Linghong): Right now it is the time for people here in the first row to introduce yourselves to everyone.</p><p></p><p>13:14 (Jinan Rd.) Moderator (Prof. Liang, Linghong): This afternoon at 4:30, we will have several independent musicians coming to join us and cheer for us. Everyone please move forward, and please call and invite your friends. Let us fill up the front rows.</p><p></p><p>13:09 (Ching-tao E. Rd.) Hi everyone. We now have set up a resource center here at Ching-tao E. Rd, to centralize the coordination of resources and deliver over to those friends who are now inside the Meeting Hall. Please tell everyone, we now need bottled water, first aid supplies, including gauze, cotton swab, first aid kit, and saline solutions, fully charged portable batteries. If you know anyone who can be of help, please come register with us. Another thing, we now need volunteers. Starting from 2pm, we need 20 people in a shift, two hours a shift. We need people to help with distributing the resources, as well as with cleaning the environment. Many of our friends at Jinan Rd walked into the crowd to collect the trash. We think we can do the same here. We know we are all very orderly here, but we also need to make sure the environment is tidy. Once again, please tell everyone that we are now in need for first aid supplies. If you have friends who would like to make orders online, please just put &quot;Legislature Yuan, Ching-Tao E. Rd. In front of 7-11&quot; in the address column. Please help. Thank you everyone.</p><p></p><p>13:08 (Jinan Rd.) Prof. Hu from Soochow University: CSSTA has never been an administrative order. How can our Legislator pass it through committee by treating it as an administrative order?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>13:02 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) The people that are close to us please sit down if you can. We will have more and more people coming here, so please sit down or move to either side for more people can join us.</p><p></p><p>12:59 (Meeting Hall) The Internet connection is unstable right now causing the discontinuity of the live stream, but everything is fine.</p><p></p><p>12:57 (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) (Short interruption of the speech) To everybody: please sit down, and leave a passage for people who wants to pass. Let&rsquo;s prevent any possible confrontation.</p><p></p><p>12:50 (Jinan Rd.) Attorney Chiu Hsian-Chi: I was at the Meeting Hall earlier, and I noticed that students are all very exhausted. It is unfortunate that the Government has not responded to students&rsquo; requests. The Government often use criminal law (assault, libel, etc) as a way to unduly pressure unarmed students and dissidents. I find this to be very unfair. Therefore we have organized a group of over 300 lawyers working pro-bono. Now they can pass the CSSTA in 30 seconds, will they pass some &quot;peace&quot; pact in the future in this manner as well? This is a terrifying possibility. If we tolerate this, we are burying democracy with our own hands.</p><p></p><p>12:50 (Jinan Rd.) Attorney Chiu from Eball Foundation is sharing experience.</p><p></p><p>12:48 (Meeting Hall) [Director] Those who have not received your lunch box please come and get yours ASAP. The leftover lunch boxes will be sent out of the Meeting Hall. Please, we all have to eat something to keep ourselves going. It&rsquo;s ok to share a box with one or two people. Just make sure you eat something.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>12:44 (Jinan Rd) Prof. Hsiao Shu-Chi from Shih-Hsin University:&nbsp; &quot;Stop thinking that the CSSTA does not have impacts on our daily lives, because labor importation that would be restricted by the CSSTA is limited to professionals and not blue- and white-collars. Right now our college grads earn only NT$22k/month on average; when the CSSTA opens our market to even cheaper labor, how can we believe we will not be impacted?&quot;(excerpt)</p><p></p><p>12:39 (Meeting Hall) [Broadcast] All of us here are pretty tired. Please find time and place to have a rest. We are not in need of resources at the moment. Please refrain from making spontaneous deliveries. We have a resource coordinating group that will handle this.</p><p></p><p>12:32 (Meeting Hall) [Applause and cheers]</p><p></p><p>12:31 (Meeting Hall) [director] I am glad that we lasted the night, students from Ching-yi University of Taichung have arrived in several buses and will join us shortly. More than 1,000 students and faculty from Taichung will come here this evening to lend their support as well. Some are unable to make the journey but yesterday they supported us at Meilidao Station and today they will support us from Taichung. Let us persevere together! (Cheers)</p><p></p><p>12:25 (Meeting Hall) [Broadcast]: It is now lunch time. We don&rsquo;t have any unexpected situation here in the Meeting Hall.</p><p></p><p>12:24 (Meeting Hall) [Director]: Those who have not had lunch please come and get your lunch box. We will be disposing the leftovers in a short while. So please come and get your lunch box ASAP if you haven&rsquo;t had lunch yet.</p><p></p><p>12:21 (Jinan Rd.) Right now Kimi, who is a student from Kobe Univ. in Japan, is sharing his experience with us. Now there are foreign students supporting our movement. So if you know any foreign language other than English, you can help us by telling what&rsquo;s happening to foreign media or friends.

Don&rsquo;t we have direct election for our legislators and the President? Yes, after the martial law is renounced, positions for elections have increased. In 1992, our Parliament finally has a general election. In 1994, Taipei and Kaohsiung&rsquo;s mayors were no longer appointed, but elected by the people. In 1996, we have direct election for the President. We become the electorate. Yet, not just that, we need to be citizens. Democracy does not end after we vote. We are not just voting. We need to be involved in policy-making process.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>09:31 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast] We are not out of electricity - thanks for concern from many people.

If you need to get some fresh air, you can go outside to get refreshed. I know everyone is very tired after more than 36 hours.

We ask you to respond our request before the noon tomorrow! (applause)</p><p></p><p>09:1? (Meeting Hall) [director] Yesterday, at the Formosa Boulevard Station, Kaohsiung, thousands of people gathered at the station to support our movement in rescinding the agreement and defend our democracy.</p><p></p><p>09:1? (Meeting Hall) [Nat&rsquo;l Cheng-Kung Univ Student] Hi everyone, thanks for all your efforts. Many students from Cheng-Kung University and many people have just got 6 buses, calling 240 people. We have just arrived here this morning, fighting against the service and trade agreement. It is the first time for many of our students to participate in this type of events. We could not let the legislators neglect their duty of supervising the system. We could not let the businesses and govt to monopolize our future. We hope we could fight on and hang in there, until the Ma administration gave us a direct response. We cannot just pretend nothing happens. Thank you guys.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>09:1? (Meeting Hall) [director] Hello everybody, today at 5 am, 6 buses from&nbsp; Nat&rsquo;l Cheng-Kung Univ have arrived Taipei. Now they are here in Legislative Yuan. Now let&rsquo;s welcome friends from our best Cheng-Kung Univ. to speak with us.</p><p></p><p><b>09:06 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [director] <u>the following is a summary for the speech of the director:</u></b></p><p>&quot;Let&rsquo;s begin the press conference. First we should announce: We are here to oppose the CSSTA, and protect our Democracy!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We welcome all of our friends from the media. Since yesterday, we&rsquo;ve received waves of support rushing in from all sides,&nbsp; with hundreds of people helping to secure the meeting hall, and more than 20,000 have gathered outside in support. There are buses coming in from Tainan, Kaohsiung, and other areas to support us. Students at many schools throughout the country have staged strikes in support, and some college professors are coming with their students to experience this real-life lesson in democracy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We are representing the People, who want to take back our Parliament. We have demanded to speak with President Ma Ying-jeou, with the KMT legislative caucus, and with KMT speaker Wang Jin-pyng, but none has responded. They instead contend that the process has been entirely legal, and they are waiting for Friday&rsquo;s parliamentary vote of approval.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The agreement is not an administrative order, it is an agreement between two states...President Ma says the process has been completely reasonable and legal. We do not accept that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Our stance is very simple. The Services Agreement affects many market sectors and everyone&rsquo;s future. Its passage will result in closer economic and political integration with China, and therefore we need to be very careful in reviewing this agreement. However, the agreement was drafted in a black box, and there has been no communication with Taiwanese citizens at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We want the agreement to be rescinded---not just back to the committee, but we want it thrown out. We don&rsquo;t want an agreement that is made and decided in such a manner!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We demand Speaker Wang resolve the current situation in accordance with parliamentary rules and sanction Legislator Chang Ching-chung. We demand the Services Agreement be rescinded. We demand a Cross-Straits Agreements Regulation that allows the citizenry to oversee and regulate any agreements between Taiwan and China. Before this is in place, we demand that all negotiations with China be frozen.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Before tomorrow noon, we require your response to our demands. We invite President Ma to come to Parliament to speak with us. Tomorrow, at the time of the original scheduled vote, we demand Wang and Ma&rsquo;s response. If we do not receive a favorable response, we will announce further actions.&quot;</p><p>--- End of summary for the speech ---</p><ul class="comment"><li>[please edit as you see fit, hope this helps]&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>09:03 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Many people are taking some individuals actions out of context and saying that we&rsquo;re damaging public property. That is not actually happening. The press conference will be held inside the meeting hall, they are already getting ready.</p><p></p><p>08:58 (Meeting Hall) Director: Everybody please move and gather forward; those in the back gather in the back, fill that place up. No need for that many people over there(?) please spare a few hands and the rest of you can come to the front. Will our friends sitting by the wall also come to the front.</p><p></p><p>08:56 (Meeting Hall) Director: At 9 am we are going to have a press conference, in which we&rsquo;ll again persist and explain what we ask for. Therefore, for people in the back please come ahead together. Or if you are really tired you can also sleep at the back.</p><p></p><p>08:47 (Meeting Hall) Director: Gate 8 is open for everyone to go and use the restroom, but don&rsquo;t loiter outside; if there is any change in the situation we will shut the gate immediately, so please be quick.</p><p></p><p>08:44 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: The director is taking a break; we&rsquo;ll be taking over the broadcast from here. There are many people coming from around the island, if you have time from class or work, please come and join us. Also, thanks go out to those abroad and everyone with their attention on this issue in Taiwan, we will keep fighting on. Thank you everyone hosting events at other places; if it is inconvenient for you to come on-site you can also go to a local event near you.</p><p></p><p>08:43&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [director] It seems like people are getting hungry. We should eat more. We have just enough food. Although we&rsquo;ll never attack anybody, we still need energy to stand still. In the medical team there are also some vitamins, so you should come to us if you have any need, we&rsquo;ll also work hard to make sure you have anything you need. Thanks!</p><p></p><p>08:41&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) [director] New information: Buses from Nat&rsquo;l Dong-Hwa Univ. and Taitung Univ. is arriving at Taipei. We are already very thankful for the bus that arrived yesterday, and we cannot even dream for another. It takes a very long journey for them to come here for Taitung. But we all believe: the value of democracy in Taiwan needs to be protected by everybody. But we all believe: the value of democracy in Taiwan needs to be protected by everybody.</p><p></p><p>(The following is regarding speeches happening around 8:20~8:40 am from the team in Legislative Yuan. We are still trying our best to collect them, that&rsquo;s why you might find them in reverse order)</p><p></p><p>Let ma also explain, since last evening, many Taiwanese student who is studying abroad is very attached. Since they are far away, they team up and make a team for translating the situation into various different languages. They try their best to tell the international what&rsquo;s happening in Taiwan and draw their concern. Let&rsquo;s give them an applause! (applause)</p><p>It should be clear to all of us, that what have are doing here right now is not only for Taiwan, but also an important action for the value of democracy of human beings. Please insist on! Soon at 9 am we are holding a press conference, and we&rsquo;ll talk more about what we ask and demand. Please take a rest at the moment, and make sure you have your breakfast. Because there are many police officers around, please don&rsquo;t get along if you want to go outside.</p><p>So we are here. Not only worry about our independence of the economic, but our life in the future. So we are here to Reject the Pact! Protect the democracy!&nbsp; Thanks you all.</p><p>It is mentioned in the report from the AFP, everything about the relation between the Taiwan and China happened from 2008, the time that Ma Ying-jeou got the President position, how he use the excuse of maintaining the economic of Taiwan and China, how he got another round of President ship. And from the Associated Press, it is said that China enforced Taiwan constantly requesting the approval of the Pact. The interaction between Taiwan and China is more frequent after Ma Ying-jeou&rsquo;s Presidency. It is the biggest hope for the government of Beijing&nbsp; that enclosed the Taiwan into the mainland China.&nbsp; Can we endure our President and Legislators sale us out?&nbsp; (No!)</p><p>08:?? (Meeting Room) [director] Both newspaper and television media are watching our movement 24 hrs a day. Beside these news in Taiwan, we also see news from 10 different countries. Among them are news from Reuters, AFP, CNN, and news from Russia. They are all reporting the issues in great details, telling people how the action of KMT trying to force the Service and Trade Agreement to be passed have drawn attention, angry and worry from Taiwanese people. And so we stand here, hoping to be able to do something and fight for Taiwan society.</p><p>I have a good news here.&nbsp; There are some people in the Internet criticized us for violent, but we are very peaceful here, right? There is a opinion poll by Apple Daily, &quot;Do you think the students are making a mistake in this protest?&quot;&nbsp; And the result of this poll showing that more than 60 % of people agree that there is no mistake for students defending the democracy. This is the biggest encouragement to us, right? Protect the democracy! Reject the Pact.</p><p>Thanks for everyone holding up at here. Let&rsquo;s give all of us a round of applause, right?</p><p>And the Liberty Times also mentioned that the police assaulted for one time and didn&rsquo;t succeed. Is it true that the police only assaulted for one time? (No!) How many time the police assaulted? (Ten times!) No matter there are hundreds of polices, we must hold up here. We will reject the Pact, right? (Yes!) We have to stop everything here to grant an opportunity for reviewing the Pact once again, right?</p><p>Reject the Pact! Protect the democracy! So it is mentioned in the page 2 that there is only vote for the Pact but no further discussion. Should we ask Ma Ying-jeou for discussing the Pact once again? Right?&nbsp; (Yes!)</p><p>The headline of the Liberty Times is &quot;Requested by the students, reopen the negotiation of the Pact&quot;&nbsp; Does it necessary to reopen the negotiation of the Pact? (Yes!)</p><p>Reject the Pact! Protect the democracy!</p><p>At here, I want to specially thank the reporter Huang of United Daily News.&nbsp; He wrote a report with the title &quot;The failure of the elected representation&quot;. Let&rsquo;s thanks to him, okay? (applause) The elected representation is indeed failed, and we cannot let it happen in the future, right?</p><p>(applause)</p><p>Another page is the support from the students of Mei-Li-Tao. People who can not be here in Taipei, but they were gathering at the Mei-Li-Tao station at Kaohsiung to give their support.&nbsp; Please give them some applause.</p><p>It was said that the medical doctors gathered via the Internet and share the shifts by volunteer.&nbsp; Please give them some applause everyone, say thank you to all of them, all right?</p><p>(Cheer from the whole court)</p><p>There were more than 20000 people gathering here. It was said by the United Daily News that the DPP has already enlarged their manpower.&nbsp; It was mentioned specifically to our volunteering medical doctors.&nbsp; Please give them some applause, okay?</p><p>After that, we want to share with everybody about the news from United Daily News. Oh I like their headline - &quot;The police have no means&quot; and another &quot;The Congress has fallen.&quot; This means there are really afraid, aren&rsquo;t they? Because the police knows this is really the very right of the citizens, so they are not going across the line, aren&rsquo;t they?</p><p>(Editor remark: United Daily News and China Times are usually recognized as media which supports the KMT party and/or sides with China)</p><p>And we are here to thank so many reporter, friends in the media for their dedicating work on the report. And thank for so many managers in the media for holding up their position, their job to deliver the reports close to what happens here. Thank you.</p><p>Reject the Pact! Protect the democracy.</p><p>In page A3 (of China Times), it&rsquo;s said that the congress (a.k.a. Legislative Yuan) has gone into its most dark era. Is it because of us? No! We&rsquo;re here, because we don&rsquo;t want our congress to be in the dark, but rather become a place of democracy and brightness. Right?</p><p>In page A2 (of China Times), Ma Ying-jeou yesterday support the team of KMT to deal with this in a peaceful, reasonable and lawful way to deal with this. If he really wants so, shouldn&rsquo;t he try to talk to us? Please, Ma Ying-jeou, talk to us! What the KMT party did in their congress are really ridiculous instead.</p><p>Good morning, everyone! I have the China Times in my hand!</p><p>They are worried all of us inside the Legislative Yuan for not having a good sleep and good food. (in sarcastic way) But actually we are holding up well. All right, the main idea of the report in the Apple Daily is the following. Wang Jin-pyng has won the lawsuit regarding his position of the President of the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, there is no worry about the President position right now. So, when this President of Legislative Yuan will put the attention to this Protest? Face the Protest, Wang Jin-Pyng! Face the Protest, President Wang.</p><p>Desert Xuan stood out for us last night. And she also mentioned in her facebook that if after sunset...</p><p>(Cheer from the whole court)</p><p>A6 of Apple Daily writes, &quot;the way the information flows and connects is the Taiwanese version of the Jasmine Revolution.&quot; Regarding citizens demanding the rights back, when we are inside the Parliament, there are many people, such as Masa from Mayday, supporting the students. There was also a cafe which announces for closing for today, saying &quot;Taiwan&rsquo;s future is more important than the income of the shop.&quot;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s see, we have got to the national flag in the top floor, for letting everybody see the honor of the congress. Right?</p><p>Our dear police officers, they are our comrades across from us. They are actually on the same side as us! Right?</p><p>In fact, the whole page is two sections, the cooperation for protesting the Pact.&nbsp; There were six buses arrived from Taichung yesterday and the day before yesterday. The students and schools that participated in this Protest spent their own money for being here with all of us at Legislative Yuan. We are having a real lecture of democracy at here, the Legislative Yuan, for all of the students.</p><p>Please tell me what does it mean in the report. Before the beginning of the Committee, the Pact has already pass the Committee review.&nbsp; Is it the way with rationality? That is because you, KMT legislators ignored the spirit of this Legislative Yuan!&nbsp; Reject the Pact!&nbsp; Protect the democracy!</p><p>[audience] Right!</p><p>The headline of Apple Daily: The wave of the protest from student is arising!&nbsp; The largest one in 24 years is here in Taiwan. And then the next thing they mentioned is the President of Legislative Yuan encourage students to stay calm.&nbsp; Is there anytime that we are not in calm, we are not keep our rationality?&nbsp; Please come here to take look okay, President Wang.</p><p>(Here begin some speeches happening during 8:20~8:40 am in Legislative Yuan)</p><p></p><p>08:20 (Ching-Tao)&nbsp; [director] For friends in Ching-Tao E. Rd. and 鎮江 St., please sit down&nbsp; as ahead as possible and guard the door, to prevent the police to push&nbsp; the line to the congress.</p><p></p><p>08:14 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [on-site leader] Guys, take a look at your partners.

The broadcast is telling everybody that today many people might receive message (Remark: From the government). If you do so you should just ignore them.

We here in the meeting hall are constantly having status reports from each location; so far all entrances are intact.</p><p></p><p>07:29&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcaster] As long as we have enough people inside and outside the Legislative Yuan, the police won&rsquo;t have heavy acts.

We&rsquo;re not sure about what&rsquo;s happening outside, so we should be more careful.</p><p></p><p>07:15&nbsp; (Ching-Tao E. Rd.) The live video is still not available.

Rd. site) Sources suggests that the police is waiting for the heavy rain to disperse some people, after which they can launch an assault. Please hold on, after the just-arriving group come we can take turn to take showers.</p><p></p><p>05:45 (Ching-Tao E. Rd. site) Friends who said they want a group singing can come to us. There is a gentleman who can help on the background music.</p><p></p><p>05:39 (Ching-Tao E. Rd. site) Six buses that came from Tainan is arriving, and 300 students are joining us.

Our friends outside should take care.</p><p></p><p>05:18&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcaster] Thank you to everybody. Also please take a nap if you&rsquo;re really tired.</p><p></p><p>05:13&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall)&nbsp; [broadcaster] Our directer wants to remind everybody that we are not&nbsp; going to take any violence action. Make sure we behave well. Also since&nbsp; there are many resources coming, please help with the trash thus&nbsp; produced and keep the site clean. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>05:10&nbsp; (Ching-Tao E. Rd. site) It&rsquo;s slightly&nbsp; raining now. If you need rain gears you can get them from resource team.&nbsp; Also, at the intersection of Sec. 1, Chi-Nan Road and Linsen S. Rd.&nbsp; there are two police cars which get put a lots of Post-it note. Please&nbsp; DON&rsquo;T do it. Thanks!</p><p></p><p>05:09 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall)&nbsp; [broadcaster] It starts to rain outside, please support the friends&nbsp; outside by sending them the rain gears.</p><p></p><p>05:06 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcaster] The air conditioner is turned off right now. By the way, in London we have people in Taiwan who wants to express support to us.</p><p></p><p>05:05 (Internet) <a href="http://goo.gl/msoErd"></a><a href='http://goo.gl/msoErd'/>http://goo.gl/msoErd</a> This is a petition to the white house.

Please be on guard our citizen friends here in the meeting hall!!</p><p></p><p>04:43 (Ching-Tao E. Rd. site) For friends here who is free, you may help us cleaning the site, reducing the work load of our team. If you&rsquo;d like to smoke or drink, that&rsquo;s ok. Just be careful not to do things that might allow some media to produce negative news on us.</p><p></p><p>04:41 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcaster] Thanks to people who have been helping on word broadcast. Answering a question of foreign friends: we have been here for two days.</p><p></p><p>04:40 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [Broadcaster]&nbsp; Bottled water is needed in here; our sites outside can use some bug repellents; there are many mosquitoes out there. It&rsquo;s about dawn time; please take care.</p><p></p><p>04:38 (Ching-Tao E Rd site) We have fewer people at Lin-Son S Rd side (such that the police is easier to breakthrough from there). We encourage friends who just came here to move over there (to fortify the spot). Also a friendly reminder that please refrain trash and cigarette ashes to proper disposition.</p><p></p><p>04:34 (Ching-Tao site) Right now we are a bit short of resources. Please tell your friends about this - we are in need of food. Instant noodle will not help, since we have no access of hot water. Please send these resource to the resource station on Ching-Tao E. Rd. Thank you very much!</p><p></p><p>04:32 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [Broadcaster] If there is no clear reaction until Friday, the demonstration is not going to be removed on the weekend. Some people inside the Meeting Hall need to leave and rest. The air inside is quite bad. The power plugs on the second floor are still working; on the first floor we are not sure.</p><p></p><p>04:30 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [Broadcaster] The time is 4:30 am. The police have taken no action so far. It&rsquo;s still peaceful in Legislative Yuan.</p><p></p><p>04:23 <i>(Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [Broadcaster] The time is 4:23 am. Everything seems all right here.</i></p><p></p><p>04:19&nbsp; (Ching-Tao E Rd site) [broadcaster] If&nbsp; anyone find an unknown broadcasting vehicle around Ching-Tao E Rd and&nbsp; Lin-Son S Rd that is trying to agitate the crowds, please help to ask it&nbsp; to leave.</p><p></p><p>04:13&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [Broadcaster] The resting friends have all one by one awoken. We are communicating to the people outside and they are preparing breakfast to deliver it into the parliament.</p><p></p><p>04:11&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ching-Tao E. Rd site) Again safety is important. Make sure you are with other people. If you meet somebody dangerous or aggressive, you can still ask for help from the police. There was just an Apple Daily news saying there are gangsters around and driven away by the police.</p><p></p><p>04:01 <i>(Meeting Hall) [Broadcaster] It is now 4 AM, while the police has not launched further actions. Currently there&rsquo;s no way (for people outside) to enter the Legislative Yuan.</i></p><p></p><p>03:58 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Bon courage, everyone in the building or outside or in front of your computer screen. Right now there is a limit on the number of people allowed in the building, so free passage is not permitted. Silent protest outside is also important for our cause. Everybody counts.</p><p></p><p>03:54&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Apologies to the friend who sent egg rolls from Hsinchu; please post on facebook or contact your friends outside the area by yourself. We do not have communications with the outside. It&rsquo;s almost 4am, good job all.</p><p></p><p>03:50&nbsp; <i>(Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Please will everyone focus on &quot;Opposing the STA, Protecting our Democracy.&quot; Don&rsquo;t be misled by issues like who&nbsp; is reporting the events or other thing like that. Right now we do not&nbsp; have free access in or out of the building, and the first floor is&nbsp; poised for conflict.</i></p><p></p><p>03:48&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Just now the director explained that if you are dragged out by the police, please take a taxi back to ChingDao E. Rd. to continue protesting. If you are sent to the Control Yuan, please call the Judical Reform Foundation or your lawyer. You can remain silent until your lawyer arrives. I&rsquo;m not familiar with law issues, and so won&rsquo;t be able to answer you, apologies.</p><p></p><p>03:45 (Ching-Tao) Director: Someone has donated a&nbsp; guitar; we welcome anyone to come and perform. Please be careful when&nbsp; climbing over the walls, so as not to damage public property such as&nbsp; CCTV cameras. Be careful in your actions.</p><p></p><p>03:43&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall)&nbsp; [broadcaster]&nbsp; We need medical staff tomorrow morning around 7 AM. We&nbsp; are short of 15 people. We expect to maintain a medical staff of 30&nbsp; persons here. Thank you in advance for those medical staff who can come&nbsp; to the scene and support us.</p><p></p><p>03:38&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Personally, I don&rsquo;t think we should ever target at media reporters even if they are hostile against us, since they&rsquo;re just doing their job. We just want to attain the change we want: &quot;Oppose the STA, Protect our Democracy,&quot; that&rsquo;s all. The Anti-Intransparency event in Taichung will be held at 19:00 (7pm), 3/20, at the Citizen&rsquo;s Square.</p><p></p><p>03:35 (Ching-Tao) Broadcaster: The Civil Forum going on at ChingDao E. Rd. is going on without incident.</p><p></p><p>03:34&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster:&nbsp; Thank you everyone, we have sufficient supply now, thanks.</p><p></p><p>03:32&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Compared to yesterday&rsquo;s situation, all the police from north of Changhwa have been gathered here, so hopefully everyone will come support us; we need to surround the police and not let them surround us. We also have sufficient medical personnel inside, as you can see on the right hand side of the feed. We know the police are not after us personally; it&rsquo;s because there is this protest that they have to be here, we all want this to go down peacefully. As for safety problems, we are peaceful both inside and outside the building right now, everyone is safe, do not worry.</p><p></p><p>03:29 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: There are more media people on the second floor (of the meeting room), so there is no shortage of power there, please do not worry. If you&rsquo;re tired get some rest for now.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:23 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: According to sources, the next important time might be 4am, it&rsquo;s 3:22am right now. We believe that our pleas will be heard. We expect to continue this occupation until Friday, when the Legislative Yuan meeting takes place.&nbsp; We do not yet have a Japanese translator, so we cannot explain to our Japanese friends, apologies. If you are coming to the protest, please come with friends; the police will detain loners. We have not heard about the event in Taitung. However we are sure there will be an anti-intransparency rally in Tainan tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>03:22 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: We&rsquo;re not offline; if the feed disappears try reloading the webpage. All supplies are sufficient at this point; not need to send more in. You can reach the Legislative Yuan from exit 2 of the MRT NTU Hospital Station or exit M8 of Taipei Main Station.</p><p></p><p>03:20 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: We&rsquo;re seeing Taiwanese in London posting about the incident on facebook, helping us protect our democracy. Great job guys.</p><p></p><p>03:19 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: I&rsquo;m not sure what time on Friday the Legislative Yuan meeting will be held; that needs to be fact-checked. Apologies.</p><p></p><p>03:18 (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast] Basically Friday will be the most important day, because it&rsquo;s the day when the Service and Trade Agreement is to be brought up in Legislative Yuan. We will then see if we need to take further actions, like a parade or so. It will be an important time for the current issue and society. Right now in Legislative Yuan we still have the electricity on the second floor, and but so sure about the first floor. No matter where you are watching us from, you are more than welcomed to come to Taipei and join us. We don&rsquo;t know if Apple Daily is still live broadcasting what&rsquo;s happening here. If you are tired, you should probably just go to sleep and come to stand with us tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>03:18 (ChingDao) Director: If anyone has anything to say, you&rsquo;re welcome to pass me a note.</p><p></p><p>03:15 (Meeting Hall) Broadcaster: Thank you everyone, this stream was started by DaGe (Big Brother), though we&rsquo;re not making any money, we&rsquo;re doing this out of our own will. The video may be a bit spotty due to bad reception. You may need to bring your own water if you&rsquo;re planning to go the bathroom. The time is 3:15, there has not been an assault, thank you for your continued support.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>03:12 (Meeting Hall) Broadcast Announcer: Hi everyone, we have enough drinking water in the meeting room already; but there is not enough tap water to wash our hands or flush the toilets. The AC seems to be on, but it is very weak. Please do not worry; though there are people sleeping, we have arranged students to be on alert at every door in preparation for a police assault. The television media has also been with us all this time.</p><p></p><p>03:05&nbsp; (Ching-Tao E Rd ) We are having Civil Forum, and people from everywhere are coming up to the stage to share their opinions.</p><p></p><p>03:01&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Broadcast Announcer: Here&rsquo;s a report; everything is alright in the meeting room right now. Thank you all for staying with us up until now, no matter if you&rsquo;re here on site or not, we are making Taiwanese history. The video may be blurry because it was moved or there&rsquo;s a problem with focusing.</p><p></p><p>02:57&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast announcer]&nbsp; On the right side of the meeting room there is our medical team who are dressed in white. They are there in preparation for the expected police charge or power shutdown, which could happen soon. Hang in there everyone. Now the time is close to the said police charge time, which could be anytime between 3 AM to 5 AM.</p><p></p><p>02:54&nbsp; (Meeting hall) Live Streamer: The previous report may have caused some negative views, and we apologise for that. It&rsquo;s 2:54am, and we&rsquo;re waiting to see if the police will act at 3am. On the right is our E light, our medical station.</p><p></p><p>02:52&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [announcement from the stage] Time is 2:50 AM. Please take some rest; you will be notified with any situation. Again, please rest, and get closer to people you know.</p><p></p><p>02:51&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast announcer] We don&rsquo;t have water to wash the toilets or wash our hands. As for electricity, there is still power on the second floor.</p><p></p><p>02:48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast announcer] because of lack of equipment, we are still using ipad for the online video broadcast. Beside this, we have plenty of food and drinkable water here. The DPP party had promised to provide future necessary resources. Right now we have no facebook page. We are waiting for further moves from the polices, and hope you’ll keep with us.</p><p></p><p>02:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ChingDao) Director: Those attending the Civil Forum are welcome to join us. The crowd is growing, so would everyone please remain disciplined outside and do not push around.</p><p></p><p>02:49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (From southern Taiwan) People in Kaohsiung are fighting with us.</p><p></p><p>02:47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall) [broadcast announcer] Right now we are having some meals. People should go to the restroom if needed and take a rest, and wait for future actions of the police if any. Let’s cheer up.</p><p></p><p>02:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) Director: Here’s a report; we have enough supplies right now, but water is crucial; there are a lot of unclaimed water bottles at the podium, please will everybody take care of the resources we have.</p><p></p><p>02:42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan reporter) Right now in the Legislative Yuan we are short of water for washing hands and toilet. Also we now do security checks for entering the meeting room; for example we discovered a hammer and get rid of it.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>02:41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Meeting Hall) We’ve just received news that besides the aggregation of police, the street leading to the back door of the Legislative yuan has also been controlled. Because we control the front and side gates, they may attempt to drag us out from there. Everyone sit more loosely and relax for now, but don’t relax too much either.</p><p></p><p>02:44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ching-Tao E.

There are a lot of people posting links on facebook today, you can click one of those to know more; we are peaceful and rational, we don’t want to conflict with the police.</p><p></p><p>02:38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Meeting Room) Live stream cameraman: I’’ll adjust the angle to give a better view and charge the camera.</p><p></p><p>02:36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Legislative Yuan Meeting Hall Broadcast Announcer: There could be some enemy spies among us in this meeting room.

If the police is smart, they will not close in unto us (who are in the meeting room), in that if the police closes in, they may be closed in (by our partners outside) too. So we are relatively safe staying inside here, today. People outside are guarding the legislation of the country, just like us who are inside. They are not here for a concert.</p><p></p><p>02:28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ChingDao) Student from Hong Kong: Hope Taiwan won’t end up like Hong Kong, I’m here to support!</p><p></p><p>02:27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Moving) Director at Jinan St.: Police are friendly to student.
