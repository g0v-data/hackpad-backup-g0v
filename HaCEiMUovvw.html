<body><h1>letter to Human Rights Campaign -overseas support for Taiwan same sex marriage-&nbsp;</h1><p></p><ul class="comment"><li>（我們是誰）</li>
<li>台灣修法歷程：蕭美琴最早於2005年提出同性婚姻法案，今年同志大遊行為亞洲規模最大（NY times：<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/opinion/taiwan-as-a-same-sex-marriage-pioneer.html"></a>http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/opinion/taiwan-as-a-same-sex-marriage-pioneer.html）</li>
<li>為何現在是關鍵時刻：昨日遊行人數，修法過程（強調bipartisan，甚至三大黨都有提出自己的版本）</li>
<li>反同公聽會、隔離不等於平等，修法應一步到位</li>
<li>美國的同性婚姻合法化歷程對台灣是很大的啟示</li>
<li>as a vibrant democracy，台灣應該要現在成為亞洲國家的領頭羊、第一個</li>

<ul class="comment"><li>I suggest not using &quot;whom it may concern,&rsquo;&quot; write to as specific a person as possible. I have met Sophie Richardson at HRW (richars@hrw.org), we can address the letter to her and ask her to advocate for us.</li>
<li>ok!thanks chieh ting! should i mention your name?</li>
<li>Sure of course :)</li></ul>

<p></p><p></p><p>Dear Sophie,</p><p></p><p>My name is June Lin, a friend of Chieh-Ting Yeh. I&rsquo;m a Taiwanese-American currently working for an NPO in Washington, D.C., and is also an activist raised in Taiwan. I&rsquo;m writing to ask for your and the HRC&rsquo;s support for pushing forward with legalizing same-sex marriage in Taiwan.</p><p><i>This is a crucial time for the LGBTQ group in Taiwan, since we&rsquo;re on the edge of marriage equality, and might become the pioneer for marriage equality in Asia.</i></p><ul class="comment"><li><s>- but we need you and HRC&rsquo;s support.</s></li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t think you need to mention it again, since it is already very clear in the beginning.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Yesterday (Nov. 28th), nearly 20,000 Taiwanese gathered outside the Legislative Yuan, demanding Taiwanese government to legalize same-sex marriage by amending the Civil Code.</p><p>Taiwan has been advocating for marriage equality for decades. In 2005, legislator Hsiao Bi-Khim first introduced the same-sex marriage bill. Through the 2016 presidential election, people elected the candidate of Democratic Progress Party (DPP), Tsai Ing-wen, as the president, who clearly promised to improve <i>LGBTQ rights and the legislation of same-sex marriage during her campaign. After the election, we held</i> the largest LGBTQ Pride parade in Asia this October, and same-sex marriage has become a bipartisan sense of congress. As a result, the two largest parties in Congress, DPP and KMT, along with the third largest party, NPP, have introduced the bill to amend Civil Code together, aiming for legalizing same-sex marriage.&nbsp;</p><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Few comments here. I think &quot;rights for LGBTQ and marriage equality during...&quot; can be formed as &quot;LGBTQ rights and the legislation of same-sex marriage during...&quot; to be more specific for readers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Also we use Congress or Legislative Yuan? I would suggest just use Congress.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;However, after the bills were introduced, a few anti-LGBTQ religious groups started to protest against them. They spread hatred, created fears, fabricated lies, and fueled rumors against LGBTQ groups, who are only seeking for equality and basic human rights. These anti-LGBTQ religious groups also requested a <i>referendum as an attempt to procrastinate the amendment process. Unfortunately, the Tsai government started to hesitate; they may opt for a &quot;separate but equal&quot; civil union law, which was a painful road in the US history with the </i>policy of apartheid. That is why nearly 20,000 Taiwanese took to the street protesting on a working Monday morning. Taiwanese are yearning for real equality, not a sugar-coated law that nonetheless carries discrimination.</p><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what &quot;a painful road for the US with the policy of apartheid&quot; alludes to. Do you mean the history of racial segregation? Since it&rsquo;s in the past, it would be better to frame it as &quot;in the US history.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>As a bisexual Taiwanese-American myself, I hereby seek your and Human Right Campaign&rsquo;s support earnestly. Since HRC has done tremendous work for the LGBTQ communities and has been an indicative organization in the world, your support would mean the world to us and the LGBTQ in Taiwan . We sincerely hope that HRC would i<i>ssue a public letter to urge President and Premier of Taiwan to ensure that they pass the amendment to the Civil Code.</i></p><p></p><p>The following are the statements on why an organization like HRC could support Taiwan for same-sex marriage:</p><p>1. Taiwan is on the edge of marriage equality, with bipartisan support.</p><p>2. With Taiwan&rsquo;s vibrant democracy and this step toward marriage equality, it will have a symbolic significance in Asia. As a pioneer, Taiwan can show the world that marriage equality is possible in Asia.</p><p>3. Taiwanese government may opt for a &quot;separate but equal&quot; civil union law, but the HRC should remind Taiwan what a painful road that had been for the US.</p><p>4. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, &quot;injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&quot; This is why the HRC&rsquo;s direct and firm support for human rights is needed to help eradicate the social injustice experienced by members of the LGBTQ communities in Taiwan.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>A number of Taiwanese and I will be gathering in front of the Supreme Court to support same-sex marriage in Taiwan this Wednesday (Nov. 30th) noon. Supreme Court is such a meaningful place for marriage equality in the US. We thus hope to convey the spirit to the Taiwanese legislators and activists who are still fighting for marriage equality. We would really appreciate it if you and your friends at the HRC would come to support us in front of the Supreme Court this Wednesday, the 30th at noon.</p><p></p><p>Thank you very much for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p><p></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>xxx</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul class="comment"><li>今年同志大遊行為亞洲規模最大、支持同性婚姻民調&gt;</li>
<li>今年尤美女提出修改民法972等五條，國民黨、時代力量也分別提出修改民法之草案，顯示同性婚姻合法化實為bipartisan且所有政黨皆有的改革共識。</li>
<li>Now is the crucial moment for taiwan to be the first country in asia to legalize same sex marriage.</li>
<li><br/></li></ul>

<ul class="comment"><li>然而，anti LGBT religious group也開始反彈，除了要求referendum 、增開公聽會企圖拖延修法歷程，更向政府施壓。日前，國民黨、反同團體與民進黨團皆有意圖將議題導致隔離立法。然而，隔離並非平等，就如同美國過往的種族隔離政策一樣，隔離的背後往往是美化後的歧視。</li></ul>

<p></p><ul class="comment"><li>Also have a very specific ask: what do we want HRW to DO for us? Issue a public letter to urge President and Premier of Taiwan to ensure amendment to Civil Code passes, would be a good start I think.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Make sure you put the &quot;ask&quot; in the very beginning of the letter.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If so, then the letter should focus on these points:&nbsp;</li>
<li>1. Taiwan is on the edge of marriage equality, with bipartisan support</li>
<li>2. It will have a VERY important symbolic significance in Asia, to show that even in socially conservative/traditional East Asia, marriage equality is possible</li>
<li>3. Taiwan may opt for a &quot;separate but equal&quot; civil union law, but the HRW should remind Taiwan what a painful road that had been for the US</li>
<li>4. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and that is why the HRW is compelled to speak up in support for human rights in Taiwan.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Once you have the letter I would pass it on to Nadia and other Taiwan media outlets.&nbsp;</li></ul>
