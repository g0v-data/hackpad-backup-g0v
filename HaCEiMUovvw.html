<body><h1>letter to Human Rights Campaign -overseas support for Taiwan same sex marriage-&nbsp;</h1><p></p><p>麻煩各位寄出信件之後在這邊留一下聯絡的組織，以及你的名字/聯絡方式（fb帳號等）：</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Subject:</b> Asking for support for Same-sex marriage in Taiwan</p><p>-----</p><p>Dear [ ],</p><p></p><ul class="comment"><li>My name is ＿＿＿＿.&nbsp; [自我介紹] I am writing to ask for your and [機構名]‘s support in pushing forward with legalizing same-sex marriage in Taiwan. Yesterday (Nov. 28th), nearly 20,000 Taiwanese gathered outside the Parliament, demanding Taiwanese government to legalize same-sex marriage by amending the Article 972 of the Civil Code. It is now a crucial time for the LGBTQ communities in Taiwan since, as a pioneer for marriage equality, Taiwan may become the first country to legalize same-sex marriage in Asia.</li>
<li>I changed LGBTQ &quot;group&quot; to LGBTQ &quot;communities&quot; for the purpose of consistency throughout the document.</li>
<li>--&gt; Changed the support particle to &quot;in&quot; as it is grammatically correct this way. Further, &quot;Demanding Taiwanese government...&quot; should read: &quot;demanding that the Taiwanese government legalizes same-sex marriage...&quot; (again, this would be grammatically correct).</li></ul>
<p>Taiwanese has been advocating for marriage equality for decades. In 2005, legislator Hsiao Bi-Khim first introduced the same-sex marriage bill. Through the 2016 presidential election, people elected the candidate of Democratic Progress Party (DPP), Tsai Ing-wen, as the president, who clearly promised to advocate for LGBTQ rights and the legislation of same-sex marriage during her campaign. After the election, we held the largest LGBTQ Pride parade in Asia this October, and same-sex marriage has become a bipartisan sense of congress. As a result, the two largest parties in Parliament, the DPP and the KMT, along with the third largest party, the NPP, have introduced the bill to amend the Civil Code, aiming for legalizing same-sex marriage.&nbsp;</p><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Few comments here. I think &quot;rights for LGBTQ and marriage equality during...&quot; can be formed as &quot;LGBTQ rights and the legislation of same-sex marriage during...&quot; to be more specific for readers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Also we use Congress or Legislative Yuan? I would suggest just use Congress.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In my opinion, rather than using congress, either using the Legislative Yuan or the parliament stays closer to the structure we have in Taiwan. Per New York Times, they&rsquo;ve used the Legislative Yuan in recent coverage of the marriage equality bill.</li>
<li>I changed &quot;improve&quot; to &quot;advocate for&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Taiwanese has been advocating for...&quot; should be: &quot;The Taiwanese have been advocating...&quot;. Then: &quot;Through the 2016...&quot; should be &quot;During the 2016 presidential election, the people elected the candidate of Democratic Progress Party (DPP), Tsai Ing-wen, as the president. During her campaign, President Tsai Ing-wen clearly promised to advocate for LGBTQ rights and the legislation of same-sex marriage.) &quot;a bipartisan sense of congress&quot; is confusing to me. I do not understand what is meant. Does it mean that it is a polarizing issue?</li></ul>
<p>However, after the bills were introduced, a few anti-LGBTQ religious groups have begun protesting against the legislation. They spread hatred, fears, lies, and rumors against LGBTQ communities, who are only seeking equality and basic human rights. These anti-LGBTQ religious groups have also requested a <i>referendum in an attempt to stall the amendment process. Unfortunately, the Tsai Government&nbsp; has started to hesitate; they may opt for a &quot;separate but equal&quot; civil union law, which was a painful road in the U.S. history with the </i>policy of apartheid. That is why nearly 20,000 Taiwanese took to the street protesting on 11/28/2016, a working Monday morning. The Taiwanese are yearning for real equality, not a sugar-coated law that perpetuates discrimination.</p><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what &quot;a painful road for the US with the policy of apartheid&quot; alludes to. Do you mean the history of racial segregation? Since it&rsquo;s in the past, it would be better to frame it as &quot;in the US history.&quot;</li>
<li>I agree with the above comment that apartheid has no place here as it belongs to South African history. Further it is a racial problem, not a sexual orientation problem... I would recommend to use an argument that supports the case against civil union law and not use a historical example. For example: &quot;Marriage (vs. a civil union) brings with it clarity in communication to all others about the status of the couple, and furthermore protects their dignity based on equality with all other human beings that enjoy this right. Moreover, a marriage (vs. a civil union) affords portability, meaning that citizens&rsquo;&nbsp; marriage is recognized beyond the borders of their own State and ensures they will not encounter problems with recognition or desire to separate, affords more legal and financial benefits than a civil union, provides broader access to public benefits, allows spouses to make decisions for each other when necessary and provides clarity to state documents in which you must identify yourself as a member of a family unit.&quot; (something like that can be effective.. please feel free to make shorter or delete as you wish..)</li>
<li>I suggest changing the last section of the last sentence from &quot;a sugar-coated law that carries discrimination.&quot; to &quot;a sugar-coated law that is inherently discriminating.&quot; since we are referring to the problematic nature of it being separate but equal:</li>
<li>&nbsp;&quot;against the LGBTQ community&quot; would be better than plural (communities).</li></ul>

<p>(As a bisexual Taiwanese-American myself, ) I hereby seek your and [機構名]support earnestly. Since [機構名] has done tremendous work for the LGBTQ communities and has been an indicative organization in the world, your support would mean the world to us and the LGBTQ community in Taiwan. We sincerely hope that [機構名] would support us by:</p><p></p><p>a. Issue a public letter to urge the President and Premier of Taiwan to ensure that they pass the amendment to the Civil Code.</p><p>b. Join us in our gathering at [各地聲援活動]</p><p>c. Allow us to take a photo with you and our campaign poster. [約時間帶著template去找他們拍照]</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The following are the statements on why an organization like&nbsp; [機構名] should support Taiwan for same-sex marriage:</p><p>1. Taiwan is on the edge of achieving marriage equality, with bipartisan support.</p><p>2. With Taiwan&rsquo;s vibrant democracy, this step toward marriage equality has a symbolic significance in Asia. As a pioneer, Taiwan can show the world that marriage equality is possible in Asia.</p><p>3. The Taiwanese government may opt for a &quot;separate but equal&quot; civil union law, but the&nbsp; [機構名] should remind Taiwan what a painful road that it had been for the U.S.</p><p>4. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, &quot;injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&quot; This is why the&nbsp; [機構名] &rsquo;s direct and firm support for human rights is needed to help eradicate the social injustice experienced by members of the LGBTQ communities in Taiwan.&nbsp; We ask that you join us in solidarity to help achieve legal protections for Taiwanese same-sex couples&rsquo; right to marriage equality.</p><p></p><ul class="comment"><li>I would change to &quot;We hope that you will consider the following statements when choosing to support Taiwan in achieving marriage equality for all people:&nbsp;</li>
<li>Further, I would keep the US painful road out of there...</li></ul>

<p>A number of Taiwanese and I will be gathering in front of the Supreme Court to support same-sex marriage in Taiwan this Wednesday (Nov. 30th) at noon. Supreme Court is such a meaningful place for marriage equality in the US. We thus hope to convey the spirit to the Taiwanese legislators and activists who are still fighting for marriage equality. We would really appreciate it if you and your friends at the HRC could come to support us in front of the Supreme Court this Wednesday, the 30th at noon.</p><p></p><p>Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p><p></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>xxx</p><p></p><ul class="comment"><li>What will happen with the final paragraph beyond the 30th of November? It has already passed...</li></ul>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul class="comment"><li>Also have a very specific ask: what do we want HRC to DO for us? Issue a public letter to urge President and Premier of Taiwan to ensure amendment to Civil Code passes, would be a good start I think.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Make sure you put the &quot;ask&quot; in the very beginning of the letter.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If so, then the letter should focus on these points:&nbsp;</li>
<li>1. Taiwan is on the edge of marriage equality, with bipartisan support</li>
<li>2. It will have a VERY important symbolic significance in Asia, to show that even in socially conservative/traditional East Asia, marriage equality is possible</li>
<li>3. Taiwan may opt for a &quot;separate but equal&quot; civil union law, but the HRW should remind Taiwan what a painful road that had been for the US</li>
<li>4. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and that is why the HRW is compelled to speak up in support for human rights in Taiwan.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Once you have the letter I would pass it on to Nadia and other Taiwan media outlets.&nbsp;</li></ul>
