<body><h1>letter to Human Rights Campaign -overseas support for Taiwan same sex marriage-&nbsp;</h1><p></p><p>麻煩各位寄出信件之後在這邊留一下聯絡的組織，以及你的名字/聯絡方式（fb帳號等）：</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Subject:</b> Asking for support for Same-sex marriage in Taiwan</p><p>-----</p><p>Dear [ ],</p><p></p><p>My name is ＿＿＿＿.&nbsp; [自我介紹] I am writing to ask for your and [機構名]‘s support for pushing forward with legalizing same-sex marriage in Taiwan. Yesterday (Nov. 28th), nearly 20,000 Taiwanese gathered outside the Parliament, demanding Taiwanese government to legalize same-sex marriage by amending the Article 972 of the Civil Code. It is now a crucial time for the LGBTQ group in Taiwan since, as a pioneer for marriage equality, Taiwan may become the first country to legalize same-sex marriage in Asia.</p><p></p><p>Taiwanese has been advocating for marriage equality for decades. In 2005, legislator Hsiao Bi-Khim first introduced the same-sex marriage bill. Through the 2016 presidential election, people elected the candidate of Democratic Progress Party (DPP), Tsai Ing-wen, as the president, who clearly promised to advocate for LGBTQ rights and the legislation of same-sex marriage during her campaign. After the election, we held the largest LGBTQ Pride parade in Asia this October, and same-sex marriage has become a bipartisan sense of congress. As a result, the two largest parties in Parliament, DPP and KMT, along with the third largest party, NPP, have introduced the bill to amend the Civil Code, aiming for legalizing same-sex marriage.&nbsp;</p><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Few comments here. I think &quot;rights for LGBTQ and marriage equality during...&quot; can be formed as &quot;LGBTQ rights and the legislation of same-sex marriage during...&quot; to be more specific for readers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Also we use Congress or Legislative Yuan? I would suggest just use Congress.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I changed &quot;improve&quot; to &quot;advocate for&quot;</li></ul>
<p>However, after the bills were introduced, a few anti-LGBTQ religious groups have been protesting against the legislation. They spread hatred, fears, lies, and rumors against LGBTQ groups, who are only seeking for equality and basic human rights. These anti-LGBTQ religious groups also requested a <i>referendum as an attempt to procrastinate the amendment process. Unfortunately, the Tsai Government started to hesitate; they may opt for a &quot;separate but equal&quot; civil union law, which was a painful road in the US history with the </i>policy of apartheid. That is why nearly 20,000 Taiwanese took to the street protesting on a working Monday morning. Taiwanese are yearning for real equality, not a sugar-coated law that carries discrimination.</p><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what &quot;a painful road for the US with the policy of apartheid&quot; alludes to. Do you mean the history of racial segregation? Since it&rsquo;s in the past, it would be better to frame it as &quot;in the US history.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>(As a bisexual Taiwanese-American myself, ) I hereby seek your and [機構名]support earnestly. Since [機構名] has done tremendous work for the LGBTQ communities and has been an indicative organization in the world, your support would mean the world to us and the LGBTQ in Taiwan. We sincerely hope that [機構名] would support us by:</p><p></p><p>a. Issue a public letter to urge President and Premier of Taiwan to ensure that they pass the amendment to the Civil Code.</p><p>b. Join us in our gathering at [各地聲援活動]</p><p>c. Allow us to take a photo with you and our campaign poster. [約時間帶著template去找他們拍照]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The following are the statements on why an organization like&nbsp; [機構名] should support Taiwan for same-sex marriage:</p><p>1. Taiwan is on the edge of marriage equality, with bipartisan support.</p><p>2. With Taiwan&rsquo;s vibrant democracy, this step toward marriage equality has a symbolic significance in Asia. As a pioneer, Taiwan can show the world that marriage equality is possible in Asia.</p><p>3. Taiwanese government may opt for a &quot;separate but equal&quot; civil union law, but the HRC should remind Taiwan what a painful road that it had been for the US.</p><p>4. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, &quot;injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&quot; This is why the HRC&rsquo;s direct and firm support for human rights is needed to help eradicate the social injustice experienced by members of the LGBTQ communities in Taiwan.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>A number of Taiwanese and I will be gathering in front of the Supreme Court to support same-sex marriage in Taiwan this Wednesday (Nov. 30th) at noon. Supreme Court is such a meaningful place for marriage equality in the US. We thus hope to convey the spirit to the Taiwanese legislators and activists who are still fighting for marriage equality. We would really appreciate it if you and your friends at the HRC could come to support us in front of the Supreme Court this Wednesday, the 30th at noon.</p><p></p><p>Thank you very much for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p><p></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>xxx</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul class="comment"><li>Also have a very specific ask: what do we want HRC to DO for us? Issue a public letter to urge President and Premier of Taiwan to ensure amendment to Civil Code passes, would be a good start I think.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Make sure you put the &quot;ask&quot; in the very beginning of the letter.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If so, then the letter should focus on these points:&nbsp;</li>
<li>1. Taiwan is on the edge of marriage equality, with bipartisan support</li>
<li>2. It will have a VERY important symbolic significance in Asia, to show that even in socially conservative/traditional East Asia, marriage equality is possible</li>
<li>3. Taiwan may opt for a &quot;separate but equal&quot; civil union law, but the HRW should remind Taiwan what a painful road that had been for the US</li>
<li>4. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and that is why the HRW is compelled to speak up in support for human rights in Taiwan.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Once you have the letter I would pass it on to Nadia and other Taiwan media outlets.&nbsp;</li></ul>
