<ul><li><b>Activities &amp; Discussions&nbsp;</b></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(Ideally finish these in week 1)</p><h2>01 Questions, Comments, & Takeaways—10 mins // 30 mins </h2><ol><li><b>What were your big takeaways about the Class 2 Inspiration phase Readings?</b></li></li>
<li>I am inspired by the detailed guidance about learning from people, such as asking for tour and capturing quotes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></li>
<li>I liked the Photo Essays as a way of looking through the day of someone&rsquo;s life, and a playful thing for the participant.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Do you have questions about the readings?&nbsp;</b></li></ol>
<ul class="comment"><li>Actually I don&rsquo;t get what is the result of the case study Vroom....It seems vague</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t find the methods so deeply explained. Maybe that is OK but I think that if I didn&rsquo;t know enough about the methodologies I&rsquo;d feel lost. e.g. Card Sorting.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href='/ep/profile/qffrnzHBurS'/>Paula Mariani</a> You can get more detail via further reading links:</li>
<li><a href='http://www.designkit.org/resources/1/'/>The Field Guide to Human-Centered Design</a></li>
<li>Additional Methods in Action video: <a href='http://www.designkit.org/methods/24'/>Card Sort</a></li><ol><li><b>Which research methods are you excited to try and why?&nbsp;</b></li></ol>
<ul class="comment"><li>The method of analogous Inspiration is really cool.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t done any researches in this way before.&nbsp; And I am looking forward to practice!</li>
<li>Immersions is one of my fave ones, very hard to manage but I like it. I&rsquo;m as well interested in analogous inspiration!!</li></ul>

<h2>02 Choose Your Design Challenge—15 mins // 3+ hours</h2><ol><li><b>How Might We Enable More Young People to Become Social Entrepreneurs?</b></li>
<li><b>How Might We Provide Healthier Food Options for People in Need?</b></li>
<li><b>How Might We Make Urban Communities More Resilient in the Face of Big Changes?</b></li></li>
<li>Find out more about the Amplify program at <a href='https://ideo.org/amplify'/>ideo.org/amplify</a>, and gather inspiration about the challenge topic at <a href="http://www.100resilientcities.org"></a>http://www.100resilientcities.org. Then return to this Activity 02 and consider if this is something in which you and your group would like to participate.</li></li>
<li>Take a look at this especially: <a href="http://www.100resilientcities.org/blog/entry/six-big-reasons-we-focus-on-cities#/-_/"></a>http://www.100resilientcities.org/blog/entry/six-big-reasons-we-focus-on-cities#/-_/</li></li>
<li>The Amplify program is planning to launch this challenge in late September 2015. If you follow the course schedule, you and your team should be heading into your own prototyping phase as the Amplify challenge opens up the Ideas phase. This will give you plenty of time to test around with your prototypes before adding your idea to the <a href='https://openideo.com/'/>OpenIDEO</a> platform.</li></li>
<li>Nice!!!!! Let&rsquo;s go for it!</li></li>

<h2>03 Team Knowledge & Assumptions—10 mins // 20 mins</h2><ol><li><b>What are the aspects of the challenge that you already know a lot about? What are your assumptions?&nbsp;</b></li></ol>
<ul class="comment"><li><b>Although we always say the youth are the protagonists of the future, the problem of economical inequality between generations and social stagnation have already become common issues in many countries.&nbsp; The situation might trigger more conflict in the long run.&nbsp; I assume we couldn&rsquo;t only blame on personal abilities and the government should set more regulation for employers and raise the minimum wage.&nbsp; However, maybe we should redesign a new cycle between works and the salary.&nbsp; Besides, maybe the problem is not about income but inflation or living expenses?&nbsp; If we could understand how people allocate their money for living, we might get more insights.</b></li>
<li><b>．Learn more about <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/22/un-cities-mega-regions'/>inequality</a></b></li>
<li><b>．About <a href='http://www.100resilientcities.org/blog/entry/how-cities-are-building-a-brighter-future-for-the-next-generation#/-_/'/>cities for the next generation</a></b></li>
<li><b>CITY Security and Open Data (Gov)&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been working for a while for the Security and Transport areas at a governmental level. From this area I know how to work with security cameras, manage surveillance around the city, how to handle communication between the forces on the ground and in the command and control center.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>From this topic I assume: t</b>hat would be nice to have a better way / more intelligent way of consume the Open Data (open CCTvs cameras, open logs from the city) for the citizen that could help them make better decisions on daily basis.&nbsp;</li><ul style="list-style: none;"><li><b>Sensors and Internet of Things</b></li>
<li>If you think of the power of sensors around the cities....it is amazing. Just to mention some that could turn on our imaginations: sensors to measure the water level, the amount of people in a place, the temperature level. Words analysis in the social networks to have a sense of what people think and what is their sentiment in a specific geographical location at a specific time.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>From this topic I assume: Open data + sensors + good ux / usable delivery of information could be a strong asset for an app if we wanted to tackle society.&nbsp;</b></li></ul>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style: none;"><li><b>Shared Economy</b></li>
<li>As you may already know, in the context of the shared economy there are several apps and webites that are changing ways people used to make business, travel, eat. eg.&nbsp; I think this approach can also offer something when a society suffers economical problems or social changes too.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li></li>
<li><b>Where are the aspects of the design challenge where you need to learn more? What don’t you know?</b></li></ul>
<ul class="comment"><li><b>How do people make their fortune now?&nbsp; What do the youth need actually?&nbsp; Maybe giving more money is not the real solution to social inequality? For this set of questions I will add: Why people can&rsquo;t fin a job?&nbsp; Why not all the people can make a fortune?&nbsp; Why some governments give money to people and not the tools to let them get their own money?</b></li><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>questions about charity, social movements such as refugees and immigration:</li></ul>
</ul>
<ul class="comment"><li>How&nbsp; does people that doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of time, a lot of money helps other people in need these days?&nbsp; Why some people that could help others and have the resources don&rsquo;t help?</li>
<li>What are the processes in place for immigrants and refugees integration in a established society?</li></ul>

<h2>04 Plan Your Research—1+ hours // 2+ hours </h2><ol><li><b>People to Learn from (Precrafted—3+ individuals // Personal—8+ individuals)&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></li></ol>

<li><br/></li><ol><li><b>Analogous Inspiration Locations (Precrafted—1+ location // Personal—3+ locations)</b></li></ol>
</ul>
<ul class="comment"><li><b><i>Dating agencies?&nbsp; Financial office of a school?</i></b></li></ul>

<h2>05 Build an Interview Guide—1+ hours // 2+ hours</h2><ol><li><b>Open General: What are some broad questions you can ask to open the conversation and warm people up?</b></li>
<li><b>Then Go Deep: What are some questions that can help you start to understand this person’s hopes, fears, and ambitions??</b></li></li>
<li>Personal Details｜Motivations｜Frustrations｜Interactions</li></ol>

<p>(week 2)</p><h2>06 Conduct Your Research—To Be Determined by Your Team </h2><p></p><p>Agree on the Length of Your Research｜Divide Into Research Teams｜Select Locations to Visit｜Select Roles｜Do Quick Debriefs&nbsp;</p><p></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Remember to reference the interview guide you created. Depending on who you are talking to, you will want to tailor your questions to address this person specifically</li><ol><li><b>Learn from People&nbsp;</b></li>
<li><b>Learn from Experts</b></li>
<li><b>Immerse Yourself In Context</b></li></li>
<li>Take notes and photos. Capture interesting quotes by talking to people that spend time in these spaces. What do they love? What is frustrating? Draw sketches, plans, and layouts.</li>
<li><b>&nbsp;Seek Analogous Inspiration</b></li></li>
<li>Visit places and situations that are different than your design challenge. These places should approach an angle of your problem in a unique way. For instance, what could you learn from an amusement park about engaging experiences that you could apply to the fruit aisle at a grocery store or waiting in line at a bank to open a new savings account?</li></ol>
