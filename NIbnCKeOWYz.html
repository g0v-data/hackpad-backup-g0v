<ul><li><b>Activities &amp; Discussions&nbsp;</b></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(Ideally finish these in week 1)</p><h2>01 Questions, Comments, & Takeaways—10 mins // 30 mins </h2><ol><li><b>What were your big takeaways about the Class 2 Inspiration phase Readings?</b></li></li>
<li>I am inspired by the detailed guidance about learning from people, such as asking for tour and capturing quotes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Do you have questions about the readings?&nbsp;</b></li></ol>
<ul class="comment"><li>Actually I don&rsquo;t get what is the result of the case study Vroom....It seems vague</li><ol><li><b>Which research methods are you excited to try and why?&nbsp;</b></li></ol>
<ul class="comment"><li>The method of analogous Inspiration is really cool.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t done any researches in this way before.&nbsp; And I am looking forward to practice!</li></ul>
</ul>

<h2>02 Choose Your Design Challenge—15 mins // 3+ hours</h2><ol><li><b>How Might We Enable More Young People to Become Social Entrepreneurs?</b></li>
<li><b>How Might We Provide Healthier Food Options for People in Need?</b></li>
<li><b>How Might We Make Urban Communities More Resilient in the Face of Big Changes?</b></li></li>
<li>Find out more about the Amplify program at <a href='https://ideo.org/amplify'/>ideo.org/amplify</a>, and gather inspiration about the challenge topic at <a href="http://www.100resilientcities.org"></a>http://www.100resilientcities.org. Then return to this Activity 02 and consider if this is something in which you and your group would like to participate.</li></li>
<li>The Amplify program is planning to launch this challenge in late September 2015. If you follow the course schedule, you and your team should be heading into your own prototyping phase as the Amplify challenge opens up the Ideas phase. This will give you plenty of time to test around with your prototypes before adding your idea to the <a href='https://openideo.com/'/>OpenIDEO</a> platform.</li></ol>

<h2>03 Team Knowledge & Assumptions—10 mins // 20 mins</h2><ol><li><b>What are the aspects of the challenge that you already know a lot about? What are your assumptions?&nbsp;</b></li></ol>
<ul class="comment"><li><b>Although we always say the youth are the protagonists of the future, the problem of economical inequality between generations and social stagnation have already become common issues in many countries.&nbsp; The situation might trigger more conflict in the long run.&nbsp; I assume we couldn&rsquo;t only blame on personal abilities and the government should set more regulation for employers and raise the minimum wage.&nbsp; However, maybe we should redesign a new cycle between works and the salary.&nbsp; Besides, maybe the problem is not about income but inflation or living expenses?&nbsp; If we could understand how people allocate their money for living, we might get more insights.</b></li><ol><li><b>Where are the aspects of the design challenge where you need to learn more? What don’t you know?</b></li></ol>
</ul>
<ul class="comment"><li><b>How do people make their fortune now?&nbsp; What do the youth need actually?&nbsp; Maybe giving more money is not the real solution to social inequality?</b></li></ul>

<h2>04 Plan Your Research—1+ hours // 2+ hours </h2><ol><li><b>People to Learn from (Precrafted—3+ individuals // Personal—8+ individuals)&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></li></ol>
<ul class="comment"><li><b>1. Young fellows who are looking for a job continuously.&nbsp; Young business elites.&nbsp; Young blue-collar workers such as builders, butchers, or cleaners.&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>Personal Details｜Motivations｜Frustrations｜Interactions</li></ol>

<p>(week 2)</p><h2>06 Conduct Your Research—To Be Determined by Your Team </h2><p></p><p>Agree on the Length of Your Research｜Divide Into Research Teams｜Select Locations to Visit｜Select Roles｜Do Quick Debriefs&nbsp;</p><p></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Remember to reference the interview guide you created. Depending on who you are talking to, you will want to tailor your questions to address this person specifically</li><ol><li><b>Learn from People&nbsp;</b></li>
<li><b>Learn from Experts</b></li>
<li><b>Immerse Yourself In Context</b></li></li>
<li>Take notes and photos. Capture interesting quotes by talking to people that spend time in these spaces. What do they love? What is frustrating? Draw sketches, plans, and layouts.</li>
<li><b>&nbsp;Seek Analogous Inspiration</b></li></li>
<li>Visit places and situations that are different than your design challenge. These places should approach an angle of your problem in a unique way. For instance, what could you learn from an amusement park about engaging experiences that you could apply to the fruit aisle at a grocery store or waiting in line at a bank to open a new savings account?</li></ol>
