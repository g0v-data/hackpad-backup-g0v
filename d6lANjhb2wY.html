Its substance still awaits being fleshed out by 20 forthcoming sub-regulations. Once the &quot;National Land Use Plan&quot; has laid down the basic national control strategies and principles for sustainable land use, the actual space planning and actual identification of land allocated to each functional area will be developed and carried out by the local authorities under the &quot;Municipal or County (City) Land Use Plan&quot; and &quot;National Land Use Area Map&quot;.</p><p></p><p>This is still a highly mutable structure. The efforts and operational effectiveness achieved by the central and local authorities will continue to affect the subsequent functions of the National Land Use Act.</p><p></p><p>While we look forward to the suitable and sustainable land development in Taiwan heralded by the &quot;National Land Use Act&quot;, the power of the people during this process is indispensable.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, the Citizens of the Earth Foundation is planning to conduct national land use workshops in the hope that these training courses can bring together parties who are interested in land use issues and ensure that their mutual exchange and cooperation can promote the future implementation of the &quot;National Land Use Act&quot;.</p><p></p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p></p><p>Indeed, the devolution of the deliberative planning process to the local authorities is actually a neutral act; it can also be said to represent a shift in Taiwan towards a local awakening, providing an important opportunity for a new bottom-to-top politics. But, in reality, this ground-level deliberative force is bound to intensify the competition between local forces and different interest groups and subject the social authority of each municipality and county to serious tests.</p><p></p><p>Social and environmental movements must also advance to be able to confront the various land issues in the future. We must understand that the civic participation and channels promised by the &quot;National Land Use Planning Act&quot; are a necessary rather than secondary condition for implementing citizens&rsquo; participation.</p><p></p><p>As to how a consensus can be reached, how disputes can be resolved, how the legitimacy of decisions can be strengthened, how people&rsquo;s knowledge of public affairs and trust in society can be enhanced, what is needed to realize these things is not only the government but also the self-growing force of the people. This is especially true at a time when so many different quarters have invested their hopes in the &quot;National Land Use Planning Act&quot;.</p><p></p><p>The civic community must be even more active in its engagement: on a central level, it should monitor the strategic development of space planning and coordinate the platform capabilities of the various departments; on a local level, we should seek the disclosure of early national land use plans and public participation, and convey to the local authority the people&rsquo;s expectations about the national land use plans and the subsequent land use administration. It should become an actual political force and should pave a solid foundation for the future implementation of the National Land Use Planning Act.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Everyone should work together to understand the national/regional land use plans and any future land plans and disseminate information about the risks and benefits of these systematic changes.</p><p></p></body>
